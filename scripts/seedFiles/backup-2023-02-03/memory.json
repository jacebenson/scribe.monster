ServiceNow has some recommendations on HI and on the Docs site.\n\nWith that being said, generally best to have initials, date, some key (task) or description.\n\nUpdate Set Naming Convention\nMake the names meaningful to the task at hand. The update set name should consist of the following.\n\nRelated task record, version, release or sprint number\nBrief description\nDeveloper's initials\nFor example, if working on Incident Management form layout from a Story. The update set name could be\nSTRY00123_Incident Mgmt Form Layout_ABC\n\nUpdate Set Description\nPut in as much detail as needed to ensure that if another member of the team looks at the update set record they can see what the contents are.\n\nThis becomes especially important when working on an entire track. If you are working on Incident Management as a whole with multiple stories assigned to you, you should list all related stories in the description of the update set record.\n\nThe update set name should consist of the following if working on an entire track:\n\nDate, version, release or sprint number\nBrief description\nDeveloper's initials\nExample: JB-2018-09-20 Combine both inc record producers\nWe added some JavaScript to pre-fill the initials, and date for consistency on the name field.

RLQUERY is the related list conditions query to find records where it's related records meet the given conditions. (I just posted about it).\n\nAn example of SUBQUERY can be found in Relationship Related Tasks of Interaction[interaction].\n\nRLQUERY is powerful\nI use reports UI just to access it in a gui\nI feel like a demo is needed as … joins is something I just keep poking at until I get it working\n\nA subquery is effectively a database join. I'll update this later but I want to get this out there and Thank Pok for sharing this months ago.\n\nAll in all, the encoded query for a glide_list field pointing to sys_user would like like this:

A GlideRecord is an object that contains records from a single table. Use the API to instantiate a GlideRecord object and add query parameters, filters, limits, and ordering.\n\nSee the GlideRecord article for details on building and running queries.\n\nFor information about GlideRecordSecure, which is a class inherited from GlideRecord that performs the same functions as GlideRecord, and also enforces ACLs, see the GlideServer APIs.\n\nAlways test queries on a sub-production instance prior to deploying them on a production instance. An incorrectly constructed encoded query, such as including an invalid field name, produces an invalid query. When the invalid query is run, the invalid part of the query condition is dropped, and the results are based on the valid part of the query, which may return all records from the table. Using an insert(), update(), deleteRecord(), or deleteMultiple() method on bad query results can result in data loss.\n\nYou can set the `glide.invalid_query.returns_no_rows` system property to true to have queries with invalid encoded queries return no records.\n\nAn alternative is GlideQuery whichs is a touch slower, but offers better safe gaurds against

This functionality can be helpful when creating customized reports or in calculations for calculated fields.\n\nWhen you use GlideAggregate on currency or price fields, you are working with the reference currency value. Be sure to convert the aggregate values to the user's session currency for display.

GlideRecordSecure is like a not-so-evil twin to GlideRecord but with added functionality. One of the most common questions that I receive from my colleagues and ServiceNow Developers alike is “What’s the difference between GlideRecord and GlideRecordSecure?” In this blog post I’m going to take you down a exploratory journey to understand the differences between, how to use, and when to use the GlideRecord and GlideRecordSecure APIs to query data from your ServiceNow instance.\n\nPREFACE\nBefore jumping into this post, it’s important to understand application and table/data access controls. There’s a great course about Securing Applications that will teach you all about this concept. Once you understand (or if you already know about) access controls within ServiceNow, read on!\n\nGLIDERECORD\nFirst, let’s jump go into a little background about GlideRecord. If you’re familiar with GlideRecord, you can skip this section. If you’re new to ServiceNow development, read on!\n\nGlideRecord is a class used to interact with your ServiceNow instance’s database from inside of a script. This GlideRecord class provides many helpful API methods to retrieve, update, create or delete records stored in your ServiceNow instance. If you’ve ever:\n\nDone a Course on the ServiceNow Developer site\nCompleted a Learning Plan on the ServiceNow Developer site\nCustomized your ServiceNow instance in any way\n… then you’ve probably created/modified/viewed a script that utilizes the GlideRecord API.\n\nOn the “server side” (like in a Business Rule), the GlideRecord API can only be ran from scripts within global or scoped applications. On the “client side” (like in a Client Script), the GlideRecord API can only be ran from scripts within global applications. Going off of that, there is one important caveat worth mentioning: you can utilize GlideRecord in a “client-side” script (ServiceNow won’t restrict you from doing that), but it generates a slow Ajax request in the browser. This request can take a long time and transfer a lot of data unnecessarily, so use it wisely and sparingly.\n\nIf you have no idea what global or scoped applications are, no sweat - there’s docs for that!\n\nIf you want ensure a user has proper access to the data you’re querying on using GlideRecord, you must manually perform all access checks in your scripts (using the canRead(), canWrite(), canDelete() and canCreate() functions).\n\nGLIDERECORDSECURE\nIf you’ve ever navigated to the GlideRecord API docs you’ve probably missed the one single sentence about GlideRecordSecure at the very top of the page: For information on a class that performs the same functions as GlideRecord and enforces ACLs,see Using GlideRecordSecure.\n\nThat’s just it! GlideRecordSecure is a close sibling of GlideRecord, except that GlideRecordSecure will automatically enforce ACLs, where as GlideRecord requires additional method calls to validate access. If you need to ensure that a user has read/write/delete access to data in a script, GlideRecordSecure should be your go-to!\n\nTo drive home the difference between the two ways of querying data using GlideRecord and GlideRecordSecure, check out the following examples. In both cases, I’m checking that the user has access to read a record in my “Cat Data” table before adding it to an array and returning the array in the function. If there is an access control present that disallows the user to read specific cat data records, it’s possible that the user won’t get back any cat data (or they will get back a restricted amount of data).\n\n\nUsing GlideRecordSecure to query data with built in access checks is as simple as that! With this class and associated API, you can have confidence that your data is, well, secure!\n\nWhen utilizing this class and associated API within scripts, the same rules as GlideRecord apply. On the “server side” (like in a Business Rule), the GlideRecordSecure API can only be run from scripts within global or scoped applications. On the “client side” (like in a Client Script), the GlideRecord API can only be run from scripts within global applications.\n\nFor more information and examples, please see Using GlideRecordSecure.\n\nTL;DR\nTo summarize, if you need to enforce ACLs when querying data in your ServiceNow scripts, use the GlideRecordSecure API. If you choose to (only if you must) execute a query in a script without respect of ACLs, use GlideRecord.

Otherwise they are all on ServiceNow's servers where you don't have the same control.\n\n## Events or Workflow Activities? Always Events and here's a list of reasons why\n1. Ability to trigger the notification from any server side script.\n1. Faster prototyping of the notification. Why? Because you can trigger the notification on sysevent.\n1. Events can also trigger Script Actions which allow you to run server scripts.\n1. Workflow notifications are limited compared to notification events.\n1. Workflow notifications need you to checkout the workflow to update the notification.\n\n## Send email that require action\n1. Ideally, emails require action and can be handled from the email. If they cannot, consider summarizing that information for a email sent on a recurring frequency.\n\n## Allow users to unsubscribe to actionable, or informational emails or not\n\n> Actively discourage the use of Inbound Email as a mechanism for ticket creation. It should be used when the sending party is a robot. Over time, the conditions desired by your stakeholders, and the propensity for user input error will make inbound email a horrific mess. Its also like Pandora's Box. Once you tell users they can email into ServiceNow, they'll never stop.

This timer returns makes the event queue process the work instead of the user's session. This is great for user experience. But, it makes your workflow dependent on the events queue. If that goes down, this is the least of your worries.\n\n\n\nNext, I have a Diagram showing the Switch, if some changed the variable/field values of \"Standard\" to \"Mechanical\" the workflow activity won't know to use the new value until you check it out, then recreate the switch, and check it back in. Because of this, I use If activities. This will result in more activities but, because the If activities are scripted, they won't break when you change the variable. If activities used to allow you to create any number of \"result\" boxes below, one of them being an \"else\" but now If's are either yes or no for results. Below is an example Switch Workflow and it in the If pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause you should avoid checking out workflows, always use events in workflows if you need a workflow to generate a notification. Some extra steps are needed to do this but it's well worth it because now you can use the notification records how they are for the rest of the system, you can generate the notification without the workflow by running the following in a business rule or any server-side script;\n\ngs.eventQueue('custom.notification', current, 'parm1', 'parm2');\n\nNow if you were using variables and are not sure how to pass more than two parameters, don't fear. Make your first parm a JSON.stringify object.

The best way to handle this is to have fulfillers go to the requested item and communicate there. You may not have that option because of one reason or another.\n\nSteps\n\nComments are not on Catalog Task, so add that first.\nThen Register an event called, custom.catalog.ritm.commented\nCopy your

Receive is unset, and check the box, Event parm 1 contains recipient\nInsert and stay on the notification for (sc_req_item)\nInsert and stay on the notification for (sc_task)\nCreate the business

KB0528655\n\nOn the notification, verify the \"Send to event creator\" is correct. This doesn't care how the event creator is included if scripted, parm1 or 2 it will include if checked and exclude if unchecked.\n\nOn the notification, verify the \"Send To\" or \"Send to Event Parm1\"\nor \"Send to Event Parm2\".\n\nOn the notification, verify there is something in the Body of the\nnotification.\n\nOn the notification, verify the weight is set. If it's not zero, check the skipped folder. Weight\n\nOn the target record, verify the \"Send To\" or \"Send to Event Parm1\"\nor \"Send to Event Parm2\" evaluates to an actual email or user or group\n\nOn the user, verify they are not locked out.

KB0528671\n\nOn the user, verify they have an email account, is active, has no notification issues\n\nOn the user's notification devices (cmn_notif_device_list.do), verify the user has a \"Primary Email\" device and it correct.

Outbound Mail Configuration\n\nEnsure the system is enabled to send email KB0524529\n\nThanks Andrew Barnes and some other random person from sndevs.slack.com for the inspiration to make this post.\n\nWeight\nSet a numerical value for the notification priority relative to other notifications with the same target table and recipients. The system only sends the notification with the highest weight. All other notifications are moved from the Outbox to the Skipped mailbox. The default value 0 causes the system to always send the notification\n(assuming the conditions are met).\n\nFor example, suppose that a service desk agent adds a comment to an incident and shortly thereafter closes it. By default, these actions trigger both the Incident commented and Incident Closed notifications.\n\nHowever, both notifications are from the Incident table and also notify the incident caller.

Sometimes, a database connection is better, it's the same work. You'll set up a import table, and a transform map.\n\nIf you are setting up a recurring import like from the stock market or some weather source the following questions have to be asked;\n\nWhat triggers this data coming into ServiceNow\nIf what triggers this data is an interval, then make a scheduled job/workflow that runs on that interval.\nIf what triggers this data is an action, like a major change is created, then it's a matter of running the code triggered from that update. I'd do this by registering an event, and then in the business rule, triggering said event. Then create a script action to actually make the web service call (via a script include). This might seem like a lot of extra steps, but by abstracting this, it's much easier to test.\nIf the trigger is a task getting closed in certain state, you can try to disable rules to allow you make these changes, or you can trigger the event.\nWhat data comes into ServiceNow, a full pull or what's requested\nIf the data that comes into ServiceNow is an individual record, it probably makes the most sense to do a outbound web service call like a REST or SOAP Call, that response you get back will have to be parsed and then dealt with. I'd recommend dealing with it on a transform table because then you can deal with the data and massage it like any other imported data.\nIf the data that comes into ServiceNow is a full set of the data, it probably doesn't make sense to do it over a web service, as those are generally paginated and that can be a pain to deal with, ideally, you would have read access to their database, and you can pull it in.\nIf not, the next best thing would be if they can prepare a single file for you to parse that you can read hosted some place. If that's not possible, I'd then look into the possibility of them pushing the data to

I'll breakdown my opinion of these thoughts and how to combat them below.\n\nDegradation of social skills\nWork from co-working spaces.\nBe an extrovert on evenings and weekends (e.g. go to Meetups or\nother social gatherings.)\nDistractions\nClose Reddit/Facebook/Twitch/etc.\nDon't play games.\nStress on relationships\nHave a honest conversation about this with your significant other to\nclear this up. If they don't get it, go to a co-working space on\ndays they'll be home, or send them away.\n\nWorking from home can sometimes give the impression you have time to\ndo errands you shouldn't do;\n\nfold laundry\nrotate laundry\ndo dishes\nclean the floors\nLoss of regimen\nIt's crucial to have a set of hours you're working and then stick to\nit.\nThis tells you when you need to get up and when you need to get out.\nLack of employee banter\nPhysical interactions with people.\nThey don't have to be co-workers, but anyone.\nGo to a co-working space.\nYour cat/dog cannot provide this.\nStay active\nGo for a walk on break, get away from your office when you do.\nDon't skimp on equipment\nI'd suggest having;\n\nComputer Chair (you'll be logging hundreds, if not thousands

It orders by \"process on\" and limits to 100 at a time.\n\nThe 100 \"oldest\" unprocessed events are claimed and a worker start going through them sequentially. As they are completed, the state changes. When all 100 are done, the thread goes back to slep and waits to be woken again by the scheduled job.\n\nNow there are a couple \"process event\" records. You can also write your own. This community post goes over the items you need;\n\nThese sys_trigger records are ephemeral it seems, one runs and it spawns another and the old one is deleted\n\nTrigger the event server-side with a

I had once contributed to the pages before it locked down. With that being said, I learned a lot from the wiki. This was the second best resource next to the old joomla forum.\n\nA lot of nights at my help desk job I remember visiting the \"Recent Changes\" to see new features that were made before they could get locked down. I found ServiceNow updates a little earlier than I should have because of this.\n\nTo get ready for this post I looked at the wayback machine to remember.\n\nServiceNow Wiki, you will be

This allows you to make endpoints return what you want without using processors.\n\nAttachment REST API\nThis is a great api to reintroduce. Before you had to use the AttachmentCreator SOAP web service. The SOAP API has less limitations then this new REST API. You can't create an attachment without a record to attach it to. You might think that's trivial, until you try to do some catalog work via REST. This is a great api.\n\nCORS support\nAllows customers to specify which REST APIs on their ServiceNow instance allow cross-domain AJAX requests from specified whitelisted domains.\n\nService Watch -> ServiceMapping\nBefore this release Service Watch was a separate product requiring a stand alone product. After this release ServiceNow it re-branded as ServiceMapping and is now built into ServiceNow.\n\nRelease Notes\n\nSecurity Operations\nThis is a new line of business that ServiceNow can sell to clients for tracking vulnerability responses, configuration compliance, threat intelligence, and trusted security circles within ServiceNow.\n\nRelease Notes\n\nEdge Encryption\nA separate line of

The Script Debugger allows application developers to debug\nserver-side JavaScript. The Script Debugger allows each application\ndeveloper to:\n\nHave a dedicated debug transaction, which applies to the current session.\nSet and remove breakpoints.\nPause the current session at a breakpoint.\nStep through code line-by-line.\nStep into and out of function and method calls.\nView the value of local and global variables.\nView the value of private variables from function closures.\nView the call stack.\nView the transaction the system is processing.\nTurn off the script debugger to resume running paused scripts.\nRelease Notes\n\nHR Service Management (Scoped)\nBefore Istanbul the HRSM was a \"global\" application.

For example, there is a one-to-many relation between User and Post because one user can have many blog posts.\n\nThe following Prisma schema defines a one-to-many relation between the User and Post models. The fields involved in defining the relation are highlighted:\n\nRelational databases\nMongoDB\nmodel User {\n  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())\n  posts Post[]\n}\n\nmodel Post {\n  id       Int  @id @default(autoincrement())\n  author   User @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])\n  authorId Int // relation scalar field  (used in the `@relation` attribute above)\n}\nAt a Prisma level, the User / Post relation is made up of:\n\nTwo relation fields: author and posts. Relation fields define connections between models at the Prisma level and do not exist in the database. These fields are used to generate the Prisma Client.\nThe scalar authorId field, which is referenced by the @relation attribute. This field does exist in the database - it is the foreign key that connects Post and User.\nAt a Prisma level, a connection between two models is always represented by a relation field on each side of the relation.\n\nRelations in the database\nRelational databases\nThe following entity relationship diagram defines the same one-to-many relation between the User and Post tables in a relational database:\n\nA one-to-many relationship between a user and posts table.\n\nIn SQL, you use a foreign key to create a relation between two tables. Foreign keys are stored on one side of the relation. Our example is made up of:\n\nA foreign key column in the Post table named authorId.\nA primary key column in the User table named id. The authorId column in the Post table references the id column in the User table.\nIn the Prisma schema, the foreign key / primary key relationship is represented by the @relation attribute on the author field:\n\nauthor     User        @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])\nNote: Relations in the Prisma schema represent relationships that exist between tables in the database. If the relationship does not exist in the database, it does not exist in the Prisma schema.\n\nBut really foriegn keys make it difficult to seed and delete data because force db consistency.

Function fields and function scripts let application developers and administrators use those functions in the platform in an integrated and familiar way without requiring any knowledge of SQL or RDBMS specifics.\n\nRelease Notes\n\nEmail Digests\nEnable an email digest, a single email that summarizes the activity for a notification during a digest (time) interval that you specify. By enabling an email digest for a selected notification, you can reduce the number of emails received when associated records are frequently updated. Admins create the email digest format for a notification and control the digest intervals that users can choose when enabling a digest in their notification preferences.\n\nRelease Notes\n\nService Portal\nServiceNow® Service Portal product enhancements and updates in the Kingston release.\n\nService Portal is a portal framework that helps you build a mobile-friendly self-service experience.\n\nRelease Notes\n\nOrder Guide Widget\nThe order guides are available and decent with Service portal.\n\nNotes\n\nFont Awesome upgraded to 4.7\nThe Font Awesome library has been upgraded to version 4.7 and includes new icon names and syntax changes.

First, this was inspired by Ratesh Shah's post. Second, you can read \"Official\" client script restrictions here on the docs.\n\nClient Scripting issues\nThe Service Portal has more restrictions on it then the classic UI. In the past, any DOM manipulation or access and use of window across scripts was frowned on. With the Service Portal ServiceNow has removed the ability to mess with the Document Object Model (DOM). If you want to use those you'll have to change your scripts below.\n\nUnsupported client scripting globals\nThe following globals and APIs are unavailable in client scripts in the Service Portal.\n\nThing\tDescription of the thing\nwindow\tThis is a object used by all browsers\ndocument\tThis is a object used by all browsers\n$\tPrototypejs selector\n$$\tPrototypejs css selector\njQuery\tjQuery\n$j\tAlias for jQuery\nangular\tAngular\njslog\tDocs\ngel\tShortcut for window.getElementByID()\nRe-usable utility functions\nMacros and any Jelly are not supported on Service Portal. Two ways around this is Widget dependencies or the ScriptLoader utility.\n\nWidget Dependencies\nIn Service Portal, you can add widget dependencies for re-usable utility functions.\n\nScriptLoader\nAnother way would be to add a ScriptLoader to the client script.\n\nUI Type for Catalog Client Scripts and Catalog UI Policies\nIf you want a catalog client script to work on both service portal / mobile and regular platform, you must select UI Type = ALL or service portal / mobile. It may be tempting to update every client script's UI Type to All. for all catalog client scripts, but it may not be a good idea for performance reasons. Sometimes, there is a valid reason not to make the catalog client script available on portal due to functional reasons.\n\nIf you want a catalog UI policy to work on both service portal / mobile and regular platform, you must select Run scripts in UI Type = All. Use All, Desktop or Service Portal / Mobile based on your ask as explained above.

I wanted to add to the type ahead a result like \"Search all KB's for your term here\".\n\nI looked at the search sources and found it has a scripted bit but it's not documented well.\n\nFinished Product\n\nOOB Search Source\nSo first lets look at the out of box \"Service Catalog\" search source,\nspecifically it's data fetch (shows up when you select,\nIs scripted source)\n\n(function(query) {\n    var results = [];\n    //Here goes the logic. Compute results how you want!\n    if (!gs.isLoggedIn())\n        return results;\n\n    var sc = new GlideRecord('sc_cat_item');\n    sc.addQuery('123TEXTQUERY321', query);\n

return results;\n})(query);\nThere's a lot going on there, but what I picked out was, it returns an\narray of objects where the object has the following properties;\n\n{\n    score:\"-100\",\n    label:resultMsg,\n    primary:resultMsg,\n    url: \"?id=kb_search&spa=1&query=\" + query,\n    //target: \"\",\n    //page:\"kb_search\"\n}\nScore\nThis seems pretty obvious to me, a integer to determine order in the results\n\nLabel and Primary\nI'm not sure the difference but this seems to be what shows up as text in the result.\n\nURL\nThis is where the browser will go on click.\n\nTarget\nI assume this is the a tag's target attribute, so if you want a new tab each time use a value of _blank.\n\nPage\nI am not sure if this does anything on it's own, in the out of box widget they use this in the defined url.\n\nSearch Source I made\nBelow is my search source script.\n\n(function(query) {\n    var resultMsg = \"Search KB for \" + query;\n    var results = [{\n

It works great. Below I'll go over what you need to do if you want this on your portal as well.\n\nWe don't have access to the body tag or the top level div, so you will have to do this for every page you want it to work on. We use three forms on our portal, so sc_cat_item, ticket, and form. You might have more, be aware you might have to add it for each page you want to allow it work on.\n\nOn the top level div that is displayed, you need to add ng-paste=\"paste($event)\" and then in the

I modified this some and got it to work by making the following modifications.\n\nThis does not work on IE11 or IE Edge.\n\nThis uses the following bits;\n\nUI Script (to load the functions to be called in client scripts)\nClient Script(s) (to add the ability on a form by form basis, or all when associated to global)\nScript Include (to handle the upload of the pasted file)\nUI Script\n// API

I felt inspired to make a post about it. Below is a list of logs we need to review for ServiceNow\n\nCan anyone provide us with Names, Tables, and Sources for the logs listed?\n\nAuthentication successes and failures\n\nSuccesses\nFailures\nAuthorization (access control) failures\n\nThis would be verbose and you wouldn't want this.\nDo you mean code failures? They would show up as errors in the logs... but not explicitly listed for an acl, an code error.\nApplication startups and shutdowns\n\nSo. Application startups depends on what you mean \"applications\". If you mean NODES than thats on sys_cluster_state in the payload look for servlet.started xml node.\nIf you mean something else I don't think that's how this works.\nConfiguration changes\n\nthis is available on sys_update_xml\nChanges to code files or memory\n\nThis is the same as configuration changes. Servicenow has no files you can change like a traditional server, at least not that we can access.\nApplication errors and system events e.g. syntax and runtime errors, connectivity problems, performance issues, third party service error messages, file system errors\n\nErrors\nInput validation failures e.g. protocol violations, unacceptable encodings, invalid parameter names and values\n\nI'd guess this would be in the syslog_list, but I'm not sure the types of items you're expecting.\nOutput validation failures e.g. database record set mismatch, invalid data encoding\n\nI'd guess this would be in the syslog_list, but I'm not sure the types of items you're expecting.\nSession management failures e.g. cookie session identification value modification\n\nAcceptance of EULA/terms of use\n\nNot ootb, but if you applied servicenowguru's then you'd look on the \"Terms Acceptance table\". I can't find the update set to download.\nPersonal data usage notification/consent\n\nNot sure what you mena by this. Do you mean like HIPAA, PII and the like? If so there's nothing to say this ssn, or address is added as a comment in the system. You'd have to add that via a customization.\nAttack detection e.g. excessive authentication failures, file upload virus detection\n\nSee Auth Failures\n\nThere is no virus checking to my knowledge of uploaded files, you can control the upload types and sizes from these properties\n\nglide.ui.strict_customer_uploaded_content_types restricts what can be loaded vs downloaded to stop xss\nglide.security.file.mime_type.validation restricts the file's mime type on upload\nglide.ui.strict_customer_uploaded_static_content restricts the files somehow\nglide.attachment.extensions

This post was helpful in my understanding of it.\n\nIf you're working with the payload, this is the payload for all the found responses. If you want to change a \"account id\" to a reference (sys_id) of a account table, you'll need to iterate over the array of the items and update each account_id.\n\nThis is my understanding of the payloadObj structure;\n\n{\n    items: [\n        {\n            className: \"cmdb_ci_thing\",\n            name: \"the name\",\n            u_account: \"account id you set here\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\nI handled this with a pre-script\n\n/*\n* 1. Pre sensor: You can change payload before it will be proccesed by Identification Engine.\n*     Use IEJsonUtility to add relevant information to the payload\n*     Input parameters in Pre sensor mode: payload, patternId\n* 2. Post sensor: You can update/add missing info to the DB based on result (Json) from\n*     Identification Engine\n*     Output parameters in Post sensor mode: payload\n*/\n\nvar rtrn = {};\n//parsing the json string to a json object\n\nvar payloadObj = JSON.parse(payload);\n//put your business logic here\n\nvar handleAccountData = function(){\n    gs.log(JSON.stringify(payloadObj,'','  '),'AWS Service Account ID to GR');\n    var returnStr = \"Did not replace account value\";\n    for(var i = 0;i<payloadObj.items.length;i++){\n        var item = payloadObj.items[i];\n

if(saGR.get('account_id', account_id)){\n                item.values.u_account = saGR.getValue('sys_id');\n                returnStr = \"Did replace account value\";\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return returnStr;\n};\nrtrn = {\n    'status': {\n        'message': handleAccountData(),\n        'isSuccess': true\n    },\n    'patternId': patternId,\n    'payload':

I go over the pros and cons of them here.\n\nWays to work with Out of Box things in ServiceNow\nJakarta and later\nYou should always add comments why you are changing and out of box (oob) script and change as little as possible so when upgrading its clear what you changed and why its different.\n\nWith an update in Jakarta, the recommended approach is to update the OOB record with comments of why you've changed what you changed, so when you are comparing the upgraded version and the customized version its easy to see what you did and why you did it.\n\nPre-Jakara\nKnowing why things were updated in the past might help understand more.\n\nComment OOB and add comments\nComment out code, and adding notes stating why you change it. This had the following pros/cons\n\nPros\tCons\nLeast amount of work\tUpgrade would show any changes\nNo referencing newly created scripts as new code is in oob record\t\nInactive and make new\nInactivate if possible, then, Copy. This is hard to see if anything has been added to the OOB because deactivating doesn't trigger a customer update.\n\nPros\tCons\nWould never get accidentally upgraded\tUpgrade will not show this as needing updating\nMay require many updates to the newly created thing if its referenced all over.\nComment OOB, add comments, inactive and make new\nAdd Comment stating you are making a copy, inactivate it. Copy it. This will ensure the OOB thing comes up in a skipped update.\n\nPros\tCons\nWould never get accidentally upgraded\tYou still have to make a new thing\nUpdate difference still shows up so you can

With that said, I've summarized what I think are the important bits. If you follow these recommendation, I think you will either a) get help sooner, b) solve your own problem and be on your faster then jotting down a partial question.\n\nMake a good to-the-point title for the question or as StackOverflow says, \"Write a title that summarizes the specific problem\". This helps because it lets those who can help, know they can without going into the post. You might be thinking, I can't sum it up it's too complex. No problem, try to think how you'd ask a busy colleague, and put that into the subject. If you're still having trouble, write the title last after all the details are fresh.\n\nGood: Set Value form variable in the request form to Table field\nGood: How to disable attachment confirmations?\nGood: How can I set an override reference qualifier to a group\nBad: NetApp\nBad: Photo Masking\nBad: Not Available for Module script\nIntroduce the problem or write it as you might have explained using the rubber duck debugging method. In the body of your question, start by expanding on the summary you put in the title. Explain how you encountered the problem you're trying to solve, and any difficulties that have prevented you from solving it yourself. The first paragraph in your question is the second thing most readers will see, so make it as engaging and informative as possible.\n\nHelp others reproduce the problem.

Others did, but somehow not me.\n\nBelow I'll go over the parts I think notable.\n\nThings to keep in mind in general\nIf there are repeating classes the later ones will be better but the speaker may have lost their voice\n\nKnow the difference between the different types of events.\n\nBreakouts are talks\nLabs are step by step instruction with an instructor in the room to field questions and assist\nWorkshops are the same as labs but CreatorCon\nLook up the content of the event. If it's not a current feature, it's probably a new feature and might be a \"this will be nice but you don't get it for two releases\"\n\nLook up the presenters of the event. If it's a partner, be careful as it may be more of a success story of how some implementation or product they used was successful.\n\nRegistration\nLooks like they used g2planet.com which this year was pretty poor in my opinion. Hard to tell what you had already selected until you tried to add an event to the agenda\n\nSuggestions to improve - Use what you used for 2016's registration or make your own.\n\nMobile App\nThis was terrible. I literally wrote my schedule down each day as it was more convenient to do that. Thankfully none of my classes moved after I arrived.\n\nSuggestions to improve - Don't provide a mobile app. It would have been easier and then we'd been complaining about the website.\n\nSocial Stuff\nThis was great. With the way, my rep helped us get around and with all the folks.\n\nLabs\nLAB1012 Manage Duplicate CIs Effortlessly to Keep Your CMDB Clean\nThis was an awesome lab. It showed a new feature that lets you merge and handle the remaining duplicate ci's and their relationships in a very flexible way.\n\nLab URL\n\nOn-demand Library\nURL\n\nCCW0194 Advanced Identification Engine for Discovery\nThis really was all about using the horizontal patterns to discover configuration items which in my case would have been great three weeks prior as I had to self-teach myself it. It did confirm that I did learn this properly. There's a great youtube video where they show how to do most of this.\n\nLab URL\n\nOn-demand Library URL\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_49vxeGz78\n\nLAB0272 Discovery & Service Mapping in a Cloud First World - PaaS/IaaS\nAgain this was a great session had I taken it three weeks prior. It did confirm I did learn the right topics and it focused on the Cloud Services Plugin v2.\n\nLab URL\n\nOn-demand Library URL\n\nLAB0299 Threat Hunting, Awareness and Sharing with Security Operations\nThis was a nice overview of what the Secops application brings to ServiceNow. I thought of it to something akin to an overview of how GRC would work except you were guided along setting it up.\n\nLab URL\n\nOn-demand Library URL\n\nCCW1088 -- Service Portal: Advanced Widget Development\nThis lab was great in that I learned about the directives and how you can use them and share them across widgets. I also learned about a different way to have widgets communicate to each other than the broadcast and emitted events.\n\nLab URL\n\nOn-demand Library URL\n\nLabs I need to check out yet\nCCW0343 Using

Trust me it does. If you want to let a page load then have it load the rest of the content later, doing this is great.\n\nHow do I use it\nFirst, you have to make sure you have it, once you understand it, you can generate it if you don't have access to it with the following code server side;\n\nvar g_ck = gs.getSession().getSessionToken();\nIf on a UI Macro or UI Page, wrap that with <g:evaluate> tags. If on a Service Portal, toss that in your server script.\n\nOnce you have it you can use it in place of authentication, if you omit it, you will be asked to authenticate.\n\nBelow is a slightly modified script generated from the API Explorer.\n\nvar requestBody = \"\";\nvar endpoint = document.location.origin + \"/api/now/table/sys_user?\";\nendpoint += \"sysparm_query=active%3Dtrue&\";\nendpoint += \"sysparm_fields=user_name&\";\nendpoint += \"sysparm_limit=1\"\nvar client=new XMLHttpRequest();\nclient.open(\"get\", endpoint);\n\nclient.setRequestHeader('Accept','application/json');\nclient.setRequestHeader('Content-Type','application/json');\n\n// Eg. UserName=\"admin\", Password=\"admin\" for this code sample.\n// Generally this is what it shows.\n// client.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'Basic '+btoa('admin'+':'+'admin'));\n\n// If you're already authenticated. You can use X-UserToken\nclient.setRequestHeader('X-UserToken', g_ck);\n\nclient.onreadystatechange = function() {\n    if(this.readyState == this.DONE) {\n        // Going to console log instead\n

As such I'd avoid them for the following reasons.\n\nIt's all client side, meaning it can be spoofed and modified.\nIts difficult to track down where something broke. Imagine you have 3 scripts all calling the same broadcast message to update a title or breadcrumb, and then one fails.\nIt's hard for another developer to pick up where you left off, since there's no clear cut methods to pass along data and information.\nThat leaves too lots of variables in how the data is delivered (browser plugins, internet speeds, etc) and can cause issues in production.\nIts not scale-able, if you ever need to build around that, it becomes a monstrosity.\nOne way around this would be to instead drop the data into a table, and then trigger a data refresh. With an event broadcast that will pull the data from the table, server side and update the data object., This also ensures someone's connection does not time out in the middle of building the page, or isn't blocked from working via a browser plugin\n\nAnother way would be to subscribe to the updates via a \"Data Service\".\nA full example can be seen on the CCW1088 Lab.\nOther examples around and about angular include;\n\nWorking example\nBlog about\nit\nBut this is the gist of it, create a Angular Provider. Associate it to all the appropriate widgets. Below is the code from the lab above;\n\nfunction(amb) {\n  var watcher;\n  var dataUpdatedHandlers = [];\n  function init(table, filter) {\n    if (watcher) {\n      watcher.unsubscribe();\n    }\n\n    if (table && filter) {\n      var watcherChannel = amb.getChannelRW(table, filter);\n      amb.connect();\n      watcher = watcherChannel.subscribe(function(message) {\n        if (!message.data) {\n          return;\n        }\n        dataUpdatedHandlers.forEach(function(fn) { fn.call(fn); });\n      });\n    }\n  }\n  return {\n    onDataUpdated: function(callbackFn) {\n      dataUpdatedHandlers.push(callbackFn);\n    },\n    initRecordWatcher: function(table, filter) {\n      init(table, filter);\n    }\n  };\n}\nThen Add this JavaScript to each client controller on the widgets that will update the data;\n\nworkspaceData.initRecordWatcher(c.options.table, c.options.filter);\nworkspaceData.onDataUpdated(function() {\n  c.data.rows = [];\n  c.server.update().then(function(data){\n    c.data.rows = data.rows;\n  });\n});\nAdd this JavaScript to the client controller on the widget that is displaying this

Know what this lets us do, such as data hiding, memoization, and dynamic function generation.\nthis --- Know the rules of this binding. Know how it works, know how to figure out what it will be equal to in function, and know why it's useful.\nnew --- Know how it relates to object oriented programming. Know what happens to a function called with new. Understand how the object generated by using new inherits from the function's prototype property.\napply, call, bind --- Know how each of these functions work. Know how to use them. Know what they do to this.\nPrototypes & Inheritance --- Understand that inheritance in JavaScript works through the [[Prototype]] chain. Understand how to set up inheritance through functions and objects and how new helps us implement it. Know what the proto and prototype properties are and what they do.\nAsynchronous JS --- Understand the event loop. Understand how the browser deals with user input, web requests, and events in general. Know how to recognize and correctly implement asynchronous code. Understand how JavaScript is both asynchronous and single-threaded.\nHigher Order Functions --- Understand that functions are first-class objects in JavaScript and what that means. Know that returning a function from another function is perfectly legal. Understand the techniques that closures and higher order functions allow us to use.\nUnderstand how objects, arrays, and functions are copied and passed into functions. Know that the reference is what's being copied.

In this post I go over what I found out about it and how it's not measured like others.\n\nFirst place I looked at this report is the transactions table syslog_transactions_list.do, transactions to this endpoint seem to not be tracked there or in the new Active Cluster Transactions loading_transactions.do. Which is unfortunate, because that at least shows where the delay is tracked weather it's on a server-side transaction or something on the client or something on the network.\n\nI went ahead asking HI about it;\n\nI have a user who is reporting slowness when they use the Post button below comment/work notes.... I have looked everywhere I can think of to troubleshoot how long that transaction is taking but it's not logged anywhere. I looked at syslog transactions, and the node file browser but nothing seems to track the POSTs to /angular.do as that hits that endpoint.\n\nHow can I see server side these requests and what may be causing that delay?\n\nThey pretty much told me the way to track this down is to look at the info in the console of the browser as the user.\n\nAll these transactions should be captured but it seems ServiceNow doesn't seem to share this opinion.\n\nI've attached (raw JSONP) the HAR record and found a tool online here on https://softwareishard.com/har/viewer.\n\nIt looks like it takes some URL parameters as well as some post

Reminders of sorts can be set up a four ways in ServiceNow. This is the pros and cons of each.\n\nThere's a four ways I know of doing this;\n\nScheduled Report\nSLA Notifications\nScheduled Job (much like incident auto close)\nScheduled Events\nEach of these have their pro's and con's, lets get into it.\n\nScheduled Report\nProbably the easiest to set up as it requires a report, and a scheduled report.\n\nPro\tCon\nA Report, and Scheduled Report\tOccurs at the frequency it scheduled\nNo coding required\tLess configurable\nNo email template to set up\tEmail is set based on report sharing\nSLA Notifications\nPro\tCon\nNo coding required\tOccurs at the frequency it scheduled\nSpecific to tasks\nScheduled Job\nPro\tCon\nRequires Scheduled Job, Event, Notification\tOccurs at the frequency it scheduled\nConfigurable due to coding\tRequires coding\nScheduled Events\nPro\tCon\nTriggers when it's supposed to\tRequires Event, Notification, Business Rules, and possibly it's own event queue\nConfigurable\tRequires coding\nRequires managing

I knew you could read the URL via $window but that isn't available in client scripts. How can this be done?\n\nI came up with the following solution.\n\nCreate a Variable type \"macro\", with a widget that has the following client script;\n\nfunction($scope, $window) {\n  // This is the controller, we've included\n  // $scope in the function above because\n  // it's easy to work with\n  var c = this;\n  // We are going to simplify accessing \n  // g_form within the client script by\n  // setting it as a variable named g_form\n  var g_form = $scope.page.g_form;\n  //We are going to simplify accessing\n  // g_form within the HTML by setting\n  // it as a $scope attribute\n  $scope.g_form = $scope.page.g_form;\n  // from here you can iterate over\n  // the url params;\n  var params = $window.location.href.split('?')[1];\n  console.log(params);\n  var paramsToString = params.toString();\n  var paramsArr = paramsToString.split('&');\n  paramsArr.map(function(keyValue){\n    var key = keyValue.split('=')[0];\n    var value = keyValue.split(key + '=').join('');\n    value = decodeURIComponent(value);\n    try {\n      var message = 'Setting ' + key + ' to ';\n      message += value + ' from url parameter.';\n      console.log(message);\n      $scope.g_form.setValue(key,value);\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.log('Error setting field', error);\n    }\n  });\n}\nThis will try to set all the attributes on the form so in the following url;\n\nhttps://dev32369.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=b480811a0f021300fc69cdbce1050ece&description=test\n\nThe following will tried to be set;\n\nParameter\tValue\nid\tsc_cat_item\nsys_id\tb480811a0f021300fc69cdbce1050ece\ndescription\ttest\nP.S. Laurent Chicoine pointed out another way to do this for an individual variable. Thank you Laurent!\n\nIf you set the default value of the variable in question to this, then you can default it differently based on weather or not $sp exists.\n\njavascript: (function(){\n  try{\n

Below are my notes.\n\nControlling variables state with fields\nFor example, setting the field as mandatory or readonly on\nitem_option_new.\n\nProblem with this is that this is yet another place to control this. You have the following already;\n\nVariable Settings\nBefore Business Rule\nCatalog UI Policy\nClient Script\nControlling fields state with fields\nFor example, setting the field as mandatory or readonly on\nsys_dictionary.\n\nProblem with this is that this is yet another place to control this. You have the following already;\n\nField Settings\nData Policy (best as it controls the field in both the backend and the front end w/a checkbox)\nACL ()\nBefore Business Rule\nUI Policy\nClient Script\n\"Reverse if false\" on UI Policies is sketchy!\nIf you have UI policies condition that is based on the value of a select variable you will have problems as they will evaluate in weird ways.\n\nInstead uncheck reverse if false, and make those UI Policies work well when the condition is met and abandon hope on the \"Revese if false\" bit.\n\nThanks Mav and Monicask\n\nUsing stage fields for any logic\nI've found that this field is not as clearly set as you might think. So\nI've started to use this only for the display of the stage to the user\nand not for any other purpose.\n\nPutting things in workflow\nCustom workflow activities (rest activity)\nNotification activity > This is another place to configure emails but these emails are not subscribe-able, not easy to re-generate, and difficult to edit as you need to check out your workflow.\nSwitch activity > I try to minimize my need of this by keeping workflow logic concise. If that's not possible, you can always do something like this >\nHad an issue where a workflow started with a begin then switch, and the switch did not build the context records properly so the workflow hung. Another reason to avoid Switches.\nExecution Plans\nThese were used before Workflows. At the time I used them they were loaded with a bunch of issues. Workflow has a lot more flexibility.\n\nGlobal Business rules\nThese are loaded on every. single. record. They are bad, you should include the code you want to run not expect it to be available everywhere.\n\nScript includes written like Global Business rules\nHere this post goes over the following patterns;\n\nClass Pattern\nFunction Pattern\nNamespace Pattern\nGlobal Include Pattern (not recommended)\nModule Pattern\nOf these, I think the Function and Global Include Patterns should be avoided. The reason being is that they are really no better then a global Business Rule.\n\nForm Designer\nThis gives generic column names to fields. Also this doesn't name sections right, so some functions like g_form.setSectionDisplay('') fails to work.\n\nCatalog Item Designer\nIssues I've been told of;\n\nNo logic available. Instead of an item with two varying options that dictate logic, you'll need to make 2 different items for each set of logic.\nVariables aren't created on item_option_new, which brings up a slew of other problems.\nVariables can't have reference qualifiers.\nEvery change to the item, makes a new version of the item with a new sys_id so old links now no longer work.\nStoring credientials in code\nAlways store these in system properties as passwords or as credential records. If you store them in code the are in clear text and that's never a good idea. At least if you put them in a credential record or a system property additional steps have to occur to decrypt the value.\n\nOutbound Rest Records (go record-less)\nThis is extra records to configure. More places to check for errors.\n\nDom Manipulation\nThese types of changes generally break on any GUI update from SN. They are also unsupported on Service portal and Mobile.\n\nAvoid using $\nIt's come up often enough that when folks see $ in UI Scripts, UI Pages, and other parts of ServiceNow, they thing jQuery

I'd like to develop these points into posts at some point so I have an embedded survey below the details of these talks\n\nResults\n\nIntegrate repeatably faster by following these steps\nSession Abstract\nIntroduction and Problem Statement\nMy company is a company like others, with data in a lot of places. In this session, we'll look at how having a consistent integration policy can help make development of those integrations easier.\n\nApproach and Results\nIn this session, I will share how we've;\n\nImproved device tracking (azure intune) for compliance, and security reasons.\nSolarWinds import to improve discovery\nCrashPlan import to drive compliance of legal holds and status in a central system\nAttendees will learn how to\nMake a import set from a script\nMake import set rows from a script\nRun transform maps against a import set from a script\nWhat is the objective of your session?\nTo show, how and why using some consistent practices around integrations can save you a lot of time and trouble.\n\nWhat are the three key takeaways you will want your audience to leave with?\nYou can follow a common import pattern to drive most integrations to simplify development and further customizations\nRest API integrations that ServiceNow has to ask for data from can follow this pattern\nAfter you do it once or twice you can do it for other integrations\nOpen Sourcing ATF tests with Github and hacktoberfest\nSession Abstract\nIntroduction and Problem Statement\nMy company is a company like others, we want to upgrade without delay but due to testing are slowed sometimes. In this session, we'll talk about how I started a repo to open source OOB Test Suites to give us a baseline for future upgrades.\n\nApproach and Results\nIn this session, I will share how I started to maintain a repo for test suites in ServiceNow. I found I was participating in my second #hacktoberfest and a thought occurred. How can I get other people to build tests so I don't have to? And it's simple. Make a repo, share it and spread the word.\n\nAttendees will learn how to\nContribute to an open source project for scoped applications\nAvoid nuances for ServiceNow's repos branches\nAccept and Reject Pull Requests without breaking and losing data.\nMake a project site for the project with Netlify\nWhat is the objective of your session?\nTo show, how and why open sourcing some scoped applications can save you time.\n\nWhat are the three key takeaways you will want your audience to leave with?\nYou can open source scoped applications to share with the community work managed on git\nDoing so can get other to contribute to help drive the progression of the project\nIt can help everyone, so, try to share in the future.\nLearn by supporting or starting your own local Developer Meetup\nSession Abstract\nIntroduction and Problem Statement\nTwo years ago I started a Developer Meetup for ServiceNow talent to do ad-hoc labs and have happy hours. I didn't want what happened to the SNUG's happening to this event so I volunteered.\n\nApproach and Results\nRunning the event has been a ride and I would do it all over again. In this session I'll go over what it takes to run these events.\n\nAttendees will learn how to\nIdentify how often and about what the meetup should meet about.\nFinding content to use for labs and / or for happy hour discussions.\nFinding hosting locations in your area.\nWhat is the objective of your session?\nTo share what it takes to run developer meetups to give attendees information to form their own OR assist their local meetup.\n\nWhat are the three key takeaways you will want your audience to leave with?\nYou don't have to host or run the event to help. There's lot's of opportunity to help out.\nAttend it, it's smaller and less formal then your ServiceNow user groups.\nProvide feedback, it's always

Use them.\n01 Mar 2019 by Jace Benson\n\nI was asked to present a lab I submitted to K19 at the local Minnesota ServiceNow User Group. I thought this would be great so I went down the path of making this small lab about using import sets.\n\nHere's a link to the deck.\n\nThe short version of this is;\n\nAlways use import sets for data from another system, and always store all the data you can see in that import set so you don't have to get into the integration to do modifications.\n\nYou may hear reasons to not do this;\n\nObjection: \"This is just a small SolarWinds import to add to our network devices, It would be just as fast to write to the table in a script include.\"\n\nWhat you should think: \"Sure, but then the moment they change their data or want to coalesce on something else, you'll have to re-interrogate the data to map it.\"\n\nWhat you should say: \"Any integration needs to come in to a import set table where we will hold the data for a few days so we can transform the data to our values regardless how the data in that other system exists.\n\nObjection: \"I've done plenty of integrations and this one just runs on demand to get the start date of a new employee, literally just populating the variables on RITM\"\n\nWhat you should think: \"Sure, until they change their mind and want it to do something more with some other element they were sharing.\"\n\nWhat you should say: \"We store all data seen from the integration for future use in case the need arises to use them based on future work. This simplifies the integration later for other to work on it.\n\nObjection: \"This just adds overhead to what would otherwise be a simple integration.\"\n\nWhat you should think: \"It's only overhead if you don't do all your integrations that way. By being consistent anyone on your team should be able to quickly identify what needs to be changed.\n\nWhat you should say: \"Being consistent on this lets anyone on the team quickly work on the same integration without having to explain every nuance about the integration.\"\n\nObjection: Bringing in data from a nested source like JSON or XML doesn't make sense.\n\nWhat you should should think: There's common ways to flatten that down.\n\nWhat you should say: Below are examples of how to flatten JSON.\n\nvar flatten = function(data) {\n    var result = {};\n    function recurse (cur, prop) {\n        if (Object(cur) !== cur) {\n            result[prop] = cur;\n        } else if (Array.isArray(cur)) {\n             for(var i=0, l=cur.length; i<l; i++)\n                 recurse(cur[i], prop + \"[\" + i + \"]\");\n            if (l == 0)\n                result[prop] = [];\n        } else {\n            var isEmpty = true;\n            for (var p in cur) {\n                isEmpty = false;\n                recurse(cur[p], prop ? prop+\".\"+p : p);\n            }\n            if (isEmpty && prop)\n                result[prop] = {};\n        }\n    }\n    recurse(data, \"\");\n    return result;\n}\nvar obj = {\n    name: {\n        first: \"Jace\",\n        last: \"Benson\"\n    },\n    website:

I found myself looking at how\nto to do this today.\n\nI'm posting this so I don't have to re-do this again.\n\nThere are 2 ways to restart workflows.\n\nNo code.\n\nDelete the workflow context record. I do this by going to the record in question. E.g. /sc_req_item.do?sysparm_query=number=RITM0012345\nClick into the \"Show Workflow Context\" UI Action Link (above the related lists)\nClick Delete on the top right of the workflow context record !!! BE SURE YOU'RE ON THE WF_CONTEXT !!!\nGoto the RITM and update the stage to request_approved\nThat's it.\nWith Code.\n\nDelete the workflow context record. I do this by going to the record in question. E.g. /sc_req_item.do?sysparm_query=number=RITM0012345\nClick into the \"Show Workflow Context\" UI Action Link (above the related lists)\nClick Delete on the top right of the workflow context record !!! BE SURE YOU'RE ON THE WF_CONTEXT !!!\nGoto the wf_workflow.list table and find the workflow you want to start, copy it's sys_id.\nRun this script in a background script;\n  var current = new

Attention: This functionality requires a knowledge of Apache Jelly (a Java and XML based scripting and processing engine for turning XML into executable code).\n\nThis page from Apache has a summary of the standard Jelly tags: http://commons.apache.org/jelly/tags.html\n\nEscaping #\nEscaping is hell with Jelly and XML. Anything you'd think about escaping\nis probably wrong. Here's the short of it.\n\nCharacters #\nDesired Character\tPhase 1\tPhase 2\n&\t${AMP}\t$[AMP]\n<\t${AMP}lt;\t$[AMP]lt;\n>\t${AMP}gt;\t$[AMP]gt;\n${SP}\t$[SP]\nValues #\n${test.getHTMLValue()}\n${JS:expression}\n${HTML:expression}\nSometimes you need to call <g:no_escape>${jvar_t}</g:no_escape>.\n\nPhases #\nUsually, there are two phases indicated by namespaces <j> versus <j2> and <g> versus <g2>.\n\nThe namespaces without the \"2\" happen in the first phase of processing and these are cached except when used in a UI page. Those with the \"2\" are never cached. Care must be taken when selecting whether to use phase 1 or phase 2 for efficiency and correct results.\n\nIn addition to the namespaces, the syntax used to insert values into static content differs depending on which phase is to supply the value. A dollar with braces surrounding a value inserts the value in phase\n\nFor example, ${jvar_ref} inserts the value jvar_ref during phase 1 of the jelly process. A dollar with brackets surrounding a value inserts the value in phase\nFor example, $[jvar_ref] inserts the value jvar_ref during phase 2. A value surrounded by quotes is treated as a string. For example, [jvar_ref] inserts the value jvar_ref as a string during phase 2.\n <script>\nif (confirm(\"$[gs.getMessage('home.delete.confirm') ]\"))\n   ...\n</script>\n<input type=\"hidden\" id=\"${jvar_name}\" name=\"${jvar_name}\" value=\"${jvar_value}\" class=\"${jvar_class}\" />\nTags #\nHere's a list of tags I generally use when working with Jelly. There are\nother tags, but I find my use of them the exception, not the rule.\n\nSet #\n<j:set var=\"jvar_element_id\" value=\"I have value!\"/>\n<label id=\"label\">${jvar_element_id}</label>\nIf #\n<j:if test=\"${jvar_something}\">...do something...</j:if>\n<j:if test=\"${!jvar_something}\">...do something...</j:if>\n${empty()} #\n<j:if test=\"${empty(jvar_something)}\">\n    Only shows if jvar_something is empty!\n</j:if>\nSet If #\n<g2:set_if var=\"jvar_style\"\ntest=\"$[gs.getPreference('table.compact') != 'false']\"\ntrue=\"margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;\"\nfalse=\"margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:2px;\" />\nInsert #\n<g:insert>, inserts a jelly file into your jelly in a new context,\nmeaning you can not access variables previously established in your\nJelly.\n\n<g:insert template=\"get_target_form_function.xml\" />\nInline #\n<g:inline>, inserts a jelly file into your jelly in the same context,\nmeaning you can acccess variables previously established in your\nJelly.\n\n<g:inline template=\"element_default.xml\" />\nCall #\n<g:call>, has better encapulation than the above two. In short, you\ncan pass values, but you can't access variables previously\nestablished in your Jelly unless explicitly passed.\n\n<g:call function=\"collapsing_image.xml\"\n        id=\"${jvar_section_id}\"\n        image=\"$[jvar_cimg]\"\n        first_section_id=\"${jvar_first_section_id}\"\n        image_alt=\"${jvar_cimg_alt}\"/>\nEvaluate #\n<g:evaluate> tag is used to evaluate an expression in Rhino\nJavascript.\nThe last statement in the expression is the value the variable will\ncontain. If you would like to have the evaluate return an object (for\nexample an array), use the argument object=\"true\".\n\n<g2:evaluate var=\"jvar_page\" jelly=\"true\" object=\"true\">\n     var users =

Often, these words are used interchangeably with another word. For clarity, select and consistently use the less ambiguous meaning for each word.\n\nFor example, because and since should not be used interchangeably. The word since can have two meanings. To avoid ambiguity, always use because to provide a reason, and use since when referring to a specific point in time.\n\nDo\tDo not\nGroup approval for {0} was deleted because it no longer matches approval rule {1}\tGroup approval for {0} was deleted since it no longer matches approval rule {1}\nAs another example, once and _after_should not be used interchangeably.

I'd love to see these shared in an open way afterwards. If this makes the competition better, than that's great and my goal here. Below is that list.\n\nKnowledge Things\nHow to win a hackathon\n2021\nA mobile-friendly platform to attend virtual classes. A better way to stream interactive online events. A system that allows office employees to order and receive supplies from drones. These are among the best ideas to emerge from the Knowledge 2021 CreatorCon Hackathon, held May 8-9.\nThe hackathon serves as a forum for coders to design and display innovative apps on the Now Platform that can solve real business problems.\nThis year, more than 100 teams competed in the hackathon. ServiceNow judges for the event—including a vice president of platform product management, senior product managers, staff engineers, and developer advocates—selected four finalists and the Grand Prize winner, as well as five targeted award winners. The Grand Prize-winning team received Oculus Quest 2 virtual reality headsets and Bose Bluetooth headphones.\n\nPost\nDev Post\nPlace\tTeam\tApp\tCategory\tDescription\nWinner\tHakuna Matata\tVirtual University\tBest Mobile Experience app\tThe app creates a single, easy-to-use platform for students, teachers, and administrators to manage their workloads and interactions\nFinalist\tDev Without Hats\tObsequio\tBest Now Experience app\tThis app creates a scalable, cloud-based system for desktop and mobile devices that allows users to report risk, safety, and compliance issues.\nFinalist\tPhilGoesDeep\tOBS Overlays with AES\tBest app started from AES\tOBS Overlays with App Engine Studio\nFinalist\tArnav Solo\tSentinmentNow\t\tUsing machine learning, this app helps companies monitor consumer interactions in real time and spot patterns that result in unhappy customers, such as lack of knowledge about a particular product or agent behavior that escalates disputes.\nFinalist\tTeam Scrantonicity\tRAID\tMost compelling IntegrationHub spoke\tRAID (Request Automated In-office Delivery).

As colleagues hide behind their computer screens, they do not form close bonds with one another, which can lead to decreased motivation, worse results and low overall incentive. The introduction of Extended User Profile - highly customizable, interactive user profiles - can be a starting point towards better employee interactions, increased workplace visibility and company-wide initiatives. As a result, employees get to express themselves freely and proactively reach out to other colleagues that share their backgrounds and interests. Other functions include social media integration, visual effects, nicknames, and more.\nMentioned\tCG Squad\tEducator 3000\t\tEducator 3000 brings the power of the Now Platform to solving the issue of education during COVID-19.

Now that it's over, before I leave I want to jot down my thoughts. Of the labs, I attended I had no technical difficulty with the WIFI or content. Others did, but somehow not me.\n\nBelow I'll go over the parts I think notable.\n\nLast year I went over the things to keep in mind, but here's a link to the k18 post for a refresher.\n\nThis year was different in that I was a speaker about the Meetups I help run. You can see the ones local to you\nhere.\n\nI got a lot out of this so I'll get the boring bits out of the way;\n\nRegistration\nLooks like they used g2planet.com again and this year it was better than last. This I thought was okay, but it could be improved. It also didn't help that the schedule kept changing after I had been signed up for things.\n\nMobile App\nThis years app was much better. It could have been better but it worked for its purpose.\n\nSocial Stuff\nThis was great. I had been invited out to two nights out and met a ton of people. See Twitter for more details. Drai's party was pretty great. A bit loud, but that's expected being a night club and all.\n\nThings learned from networking\nWeWork bought meetup.com and does free hosting for paid meetups\nServiceNow is upping Flow Designer free transactions to 1 Million\nNo one is happy with the new licensing model with Madrid\nI found 14 unused #know19 passes this year. Next year I'm going to try to do something with that.\nThe hackathon is a great place to learn a new feature but it's not a hackathon. They expect you to have the app prebuilt before you get there.\nLabs\nCCW1630 Extension points: How to get other developers to improve your app\n@pheedbaq is the man behind this lab. It was really well done. He had us update a bike borrowing application. I don't think I can properly explain this but, in short this is what I think it is. A better way to let others replace code in a scope.\n\nLab URL\n\nOn-demand Library URL\n\nCCB1089 Making the most of the ServiceNow MID Server\nThis was amazing and performed by Mark Scott. I'm not sure how much he practiced it, but he came off like a pro. This talk checked all the boxes in my opinion.\n\nIt was Entertaining, Educational, and Actionable. Not to mention he used R to determine if a photo is a hotdog or not a hotdog just like they did in Silicon Valley on HBO.\n\nIn my opinion this was the best session I went to. (If you all have a recording of this on YouTube let me know and I'll add a link.)\n\nOn-demand Library URL\n\nCCB1419 ServiceNow Developer Meetup and community Building\nThis was a really open discussion between Andrew Barnes, Lily Li, Todd Volpe, Melhem El-Achkar, and Fernando Luiz Goulart.\n\nIt was great. We all introduced ourselves and talked about the struggles and the best way to do things in the meetup. I had been due to talk on the 1st floor 1/2 way through this talk. One of the attendees followed me down and I met her after my talk. She's from Mexico and wants to have one in her area. I hope it starts up. I'd love to go and see it happen.\n\nBRE1340 - A city in the cloud: How Minneapolis is driving digital transformation on the Now Platform\nI lived in Minneapolis and know the speaker and some of the developers who did a lot of the work featured in this talk.\n\nI just have this to say about the talk. Gina F. did a great job! I loved the slide where you could here her passion for the city.\n\nAlso all the business problems they solved were amazing.\n\nOn-demand Library URL\n\nCCDT0335 - Influence and learn by running a local developer Meetup\nI had practiced this talk a few times and was fortunate enough to have a lot of support in the audience. Thanks;\n\nLida, Jarod M, Anna Baker, Casey, Kevin Karyadi, Will Weaver, Stephen Phayre., and Andrew Colson\n\nI ran too fast but there were plenty of time for questions and there were a number of great questions.\n\nOn-demand Library URL\n\nCCW1547 -- Full-stack adventures in ServiceNow-land: part one\nThis lab was a large lab. A lot of content to make your way through.\nHowever it is a lab where you make end to end peer review application.\n\nLab URL\n\nOn-demand Library URL\n\nCCB0433 Under the hood of Flow Designer and IntegrationHub with the engine developers\nI've been a big advocate that instead of flow designer ServiceNow should have improved the workflow engine. With that being said that isn't happening.\n\nDon't use gs sleep\nDon't do looping delay anti patterns\nUnderstand that flows aren't versioned like workflows\nLabs I need to check out yet\nCCDT1827

While legacy, custom processors will continue to be supported, creating new custom processors has been deprecated. Instead, please use the Scripted REST APIs. The following information is left in the documentation for existing processors only.\nYou can still create them, so it's just a recommendation\nMid server property mid.download.through.instance\n\nIn previous releases, this property was set to true to force all MID Servers to upgrade through the instance and was configurable by customers. In the New York release, auto-upgrades are performed by the MID Server host computer and not by the instance. To implement this behavior, the default value of this property was changed to false, and the property was concealed to protect the setting. DO NOT change the value of this property.\nUpdated things\n\nMulti-row variable set\n\nWhen you clone a request that contains a multi-row variable set, the information that is specified in the multi-row variable set is available in all cloned requests.\nA multi-row variable set is now visible in the variable summarizer in Service Portal.\nSet a limit to the number of rows that you can add to a multi-row variable set by using the `max_rows` attribute in the Variable Set attributes field.\nNew things\n\nRemote Tables\n\nRetrieve external data using remote tables and scripts\\\n\nretrieve the data from external sources or from another instance with REST or SOAP services. The external data lives in the memory in read-only mode, which makes the data temporary, or transient, within the Now Platform.

That's where you come in. Use your professional skills to help us shape a solution that will make our customers happy, without breaking the bank.\n\nI've been on most sides of the equation when it comes to this. I started as a help desk technician. Then I tried to help define the requirements that we needed. I've been a consultant where I fulfilled the requirements. Now I'm a customer again. When you're a customer, you don't care how it works, just that it works. At least that was my opinion back then. Now, I push back. I ask why. I get the details that drive to the question, \"What business problem does this solve?\" You should to.\n\nYou are the expert\nYou were hired or at least you are probably working as the subject matter expert. If you didn't push back or give reasons why the requirement they've given is poor/bad why wouldn't they keep doing this? When someone asks;\n\nCustomer: Hey SME, Add this checkbox on Incident called \"Outage\"\n\nYou: I can do that, but why do you want this?\n\nThat's all this post is about.\nUntil they give you the reason, or the business problem this solves. I'd wait to do it.\n\nI've spent countless hours head down working on code that never got released because I never asked this. Sure. They are paying you either via payroll or via a contract, but, if you didn't ask you wouldn't be doing you're job. It's critical you ask.\n\nHow I handle poor requirements\nI'll go over adding that field above.\n\nCustomer: Hey SME, Add this checkbox on Incident called \"Outage\"\n\nYou: I can do that, but why do you want this?\n\nCustomer: Don't ask why, just do it.\n\nYou: If I didn't ask, you could hire anyone to do this.\nI've done this in the past, and knowing why is crucial to ensuring this is the right thing to solve the problem.\nWhen you don't present a problem, it's concerning because you might not be considering other factors.\n\nCustomer: Like what? Less is worst!\n\nYou: Licensing, whose maintaining the value of the field, what is going to keep it in check,\nand setting an expectation that anyone can add an arbitrary number of fields on incident.\n\nCustomer: This is just for reporting. We want to know when and for what customers an incident is considered an outage.\n\nYou: ...🤦‍♂️\n\nYou can see how this might keep going down different ways. Maybe the right call here is use the  cmdb_ci_outagetable. Maybe the right call is to use a metric. In any case. Adding a field is probably not the right way to solve this.\n\nLet me end here by quoting Chuck's ending remarks;\n\nFirst, Seek to understand their needs. Don't take their solution at face value when you haven't understood the problem.

If 80% of the requests for a complicated item are in favor of one type of response, I'd argue, you should either assume every request is for that option, or make a separate item for the other option.\n\nWhy?\nThat makes so many more thing to maintain ( I hear my self asking ). Well, if you keep it, the item is more complex. Therefor it's less likely to get filled out, or users will more likely dislike the process of putting that data in. Lets look at a real-world example.\n\nConsider the item, \"ServiceNow Access or Group Membership\". Now, lets think about the title, it doesn't indicate an action to add or remove. We've used this item for all group changes. This might seem like a simple item, but lets consider the kinds of questions on this form;\n\nAre you adding or removing a user?\nWhat group\nWhat user\nWhy is access needed\nNow of the 7K items that I can see in our system 80% are to add a user. If we had only made this item to add users, 8 out of 10 requests we could have avoided that question. Additionally, asking \"Why is access needed\" is only filled out 1/2 the time and normally doesn't make any difference on the request.\n\nWhat does this form look like when it's simplified?\n\nWhat group needs this new member?\nWho is this new member?\nNow about the removing of a user, I'd say it would make more sense to separate that into a separate item. Once items are simplified you can have other systems potentially digest them. Imagine searching for \"how to add a user to a group\" and being asked by Clippy if you'd like to add a user to a group, without leaving search, and having it render this simple item.\n\nTo me that sounds delightful. It just bothers me so much that I've been all about full end-to-end automation until now. I'm not saying that those details are not needed. Sometimes those details will require someone to actually talk to the person who asked for this item. That is not so bad.\n\nWhat about more complex items?\nSo sure, lets talk about two other more complex items.\n\nLet's say one is for a company provided phone and phones available per country are different and varying depending on availability. So maybe you made a few tables to allow the telephony folks to control this item without having to actually change the item.\nThis right now seems too complex for me to breakdown in the same way. This form however allows for different things based on \"why\" the request is being made. E.g. Lost, New Hire, Up for renewal.\nAgain I'd argue we probably don't need the why, and should leave that up to the telephony group to\nask the requester.\nRequesting a certificate, you know like SSL certificates\nHere things that are needed are the domain, the type of certificate (e.g. Standard, SAN, Wildcard), a password, an responsible group.

The code I wrote was a quick fix, but I think others might find it useful.\n\nWithout any delay here it is;\n\nvar stories = new GlideRecord('rm_story');\nvar query =

I'm not proud of them. I'm just glad I didn't have to look at them later.\n\nHad I thought about what Mark Ragavan wrote about, it would have saved me probably days over my development time in the last 10 years.\n\nReally, there's some common types of checks and actions for dates.\n\nIs it in the past?\nIs it within a window? e.g. After 7 days from now.\nIs it after another date on the form?\nTo show this I'll add some reproduction steps below. Start out with my ATF Scoped App;\n\nOn your PDI import my \"ATF\" scoped app.\nURL: https://github.com/jacebenson/atf.git\nChange scope to \"ATF\"\nGoto maintain items, and look for \"Test Item\"\nNow that you're here we can quickly test this out.\n\nDisallow past dates\nCreate a UI Policy with the condition, Date Before Today.\n\n\nAdd a UI Policy action for the field Date and check the clear value checkbox.\n\n\n\nUpdate the variable Date to have Example text of \"Date cannot be in the past.\"\n\n\n\nTry it out.\n\nNow that you've seen it, it should be pretty clear how to apply this to a number of different situations. I just wanted to share as this is a great way for me to remember.\n\nFurther Reading: No Code dates validations thru Catalog UI

It's part of the Non-Interactive Session Plugin.\n\nNow this is where this post was going to end. I had gone into how I do service accounts.\n\nHow I manage them\nCreate a group called \"ServiceNow Service Accounts\"\nWe have a process in place when someone wants to be added to a group they submit and item. It has an approval to the manager. If Approved a script adds them to the group. Otherwise they don't get added.\nOnce added to the group the roles attached, itil, and rest_api_explorer are given. You could add other older roles like the SOAP roles but we encourage REST.\nLet the owner of the service account figure out their calls.\nOnce those calls are sorted. Remove gui access.\nWe use SSO so user's can't use their personal account to do the REST calls outside of the browser. We make the new user have a manager of the person who is asking for the service account. If the service account needs more access, we can add it to other groups where the access is proper.

So the real benefit is just keeping the data up to date and OUT of ServiceNow.\n\nFor this example I'm going to use https://www.alphavantage.co/ to get Stock information.\n\nThe table I'm going to make is going to have the data for the quote api. It has this data in a response for this;\n\nhttps://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=GLOBAL_QUOTE&symbol=MSFT&apikey=demo\n\n{\n    \"Global Quote\": {\n        \"01. symbol\": \"MSFT\",\n        \"02. open\": \"138.6100\",\n        \"03. high\": \"139.3800\",\n        \"04. low\": \"136.4600\",\n        \"05. price\": \"137.7100\",\n        \"06. volume\": \"23466701\",\n        \"07. latest trading day\": \"2019-08-09\",\n        \"08. previous close\": \"138.8900\",\n        \"09. change\": \"-1.1800\",\n        \"10. change percent\": \"-0.8496%\"\n    }\n}\nSo I'll store all of it and use the \"symbol\" as the unique key, some how. It has to be a \"sys_id\" but... in this case \"MSFT\" isn't long enough. I guess we'll get there when we get there.\n\nSo here's the steps I'm taking in order (in global)\n\nCreate a remote table (u_st_stock)\nCreate columns;\nu_symbol - String\nu_open - Floating Point Number\nu_high - Floating Point Number\nu_low - Floating Point Number\nu_price - Floating Point Number\nu_volume - Integer\nu_latest_trading_day - Date\nu_previous_close - Floating Point Number\nu_change - Floating Point Number\nu_change_percent - Floating Point Number\nCreate a Remote Table Definition(sys_script_vtable)\nThis is not as simple as I'd like. I was hoping to use some simple stock price for the NYSE however, there is not a good source for that in its entirety.\nSo I defaulted it to load 5 stocks and if a search occurred, I returned those results. But pretty much if your data is rate limited, or doesn't allow return of > 5 records, this becomes really painful.\nAlso if you need it to work with searches, it seems that the only way to get field searches is to get the encoded query and parse the bits out. There is no helper function for that if the search is a field STARTSWITH, ENDSWITH or CONTAINS which is used if you have the inputs on the headers of the list.\n\nTL;DR - Remote tables are neat, but have some limitations.

Here's the link to the documentation.\nHowever, it's so short I'll put the text here too;\n\nHTML auto-suggestions\nEdit HTML and Jelly scripts and define what is rendered when the page is displayed.\nThe script can contain either static XHTML or dynamically generated content that is defined as Jelly and can call script includes and UI macros.\nJS Beautify\nFormat code by applying the proper indentation to the script.\nContext menu\nEnable the context menu options for script includes, Glide APIs, and tables in the JavaScript editor.\n\nWith the context menu options, your users can navigate to:\\\n\nScript include definitions\\\nGlide API documentation\\\nSystem and custom table definitions and data\nWell here I'm going to go over the them.\n\nHTML auto-suggestions\nWell this is a very overdue convenience. But at least it's here... Or it's allegedly here. When I tried it by going toa new UI page, modify the XML adding <div>test then starting to type </ nothing came up.. so maybe this isn't here.\n\nJS Beautify\nThis isn't really clear that you apply you're own settings here. However you can. It's controlled via this property, glide.ui.syntax_editor.linter.eslint_config.\nThis appears to just take a eslint json config object. An example one would be like this;\n\nFeel free to read more up on eslint here on their docs site.\n\nAlso thanks Dominik Simunek for the info to look into this.\n\nContext Menus for script fields\nI noticed the context menu thing before I read about it. If you have a script include or client script where you invoke some script include, they now show up bold and italicized. If you right-click on anything like that, you'll get a few options;\n\nShow Documentation (which will bring you to docs.servicenow.com for that object)\nShow Definition (which will bring you to the

It's a design choice that you cannot make the MRVS variables dependent on variables outside of the row. The way around this is to add the variable to the MVRS and use that copy instead of the non-MVRS. I don't see another way around this.\n\nNow that is dealt with the only time this comes up is if you seem to want to use a Lookup Select variable that re-evaluates based on other variables. I've written about this in the past here. If you're not familiar with it might be worth reading that.\n\nNow I'm going to add reproduction steps cause I don't want to re-create things all over.\nSo lets decide out test. Let's load all .. notification devices for a user, based on a user variable.\n\nOn your PDI import my \"ATF\" scoped app.\nURL: https://github.com/jacebenson/atf.git\nChange scope to \"ATF\"\nGoto maintain items, and look for \"Test Item\"\nOpen the variable set \"Multi Row Variable Set\"\nAt this point you should see a \"question\" and \"answer\"\nRename \"question\" to \"user\"\nChange it's type to \"reference\" to sys_user\nRename \"answer\" to \"device\"\nChange it's type to \"lookup select box\"\nSet it's table to cmn_notif_device\nAdd a variable attribute of ref_qual_elements=user\nAdd a reference qualifier of\njavascript: 'user=' + current.variables.user\nNow when I try this is just works.\n\nNow say you don't want the Reference in the MVRS. Okay. I have a Reference variable on this test item already, it has a silly name, \"Reference\". But it works. Lets try that and change the variable attribute and reference qualifier.\n\nChange variable attribute to ref_qual_elements=Reference\nAdd a reference qualifier of\njavascript: 'user=' + current.variables.Reference\nYou'll notice this doesn't appear to work.

I think having\na certificate is great for ServiceNow, and for your employer if you're a consultant\nbecause it adds to their partner level stuff. You know what is better? Something.\nThat. You. Make.\n\nMake something, make anything. If it's something you find useful, share that.\n\nJobs that post that they require a certificate, don't know the ins-and-outs of\nwhat is entailed in getting, and maintaining the certificate. They are not cheap.\n\nLet's follow one of my... Twitter threads;\n\n\nLet me just say this one more time. If I were hiring, and as the top survey had shown, showing results is better than a certificate any day. I'd suggest creating something instead of getting certified.

Here's my thoughts so far.\n\nTable\tLabel\tReason\tExtensible OOTB\ncmdb_*\tConfiguration Items\tDesign Choice - has a Class field and it's in use\tMany No\ncmn_location\tLocation\tSee notes below\tNo\ncmn_schedule_condition new\t\t\tYes\ndl_definition\tData Lookup Definition\tDesign Choice - has a Class field and it's not used\tYes\ndl_matcher\tData Lookup Matcher Rules\tDesign Choice - has a Class field and it's in use\tYes\nkb_knowlege\tKnowledge\t\tNo\nsc_cat_item_delivery_task\tExection Plan Task []\tDesign Choice - has a Class field and it's in use\tYes\nscheduled_data_import new\t\t\tYes\nsf_state_flow\tState Flow\tDesign Choice - has a Class field and it's not used\tYes\nsys_auth_profile\tAuthentication Profile\tDesign Choice - has a Class field and it's not used\tYes\nsys_choice\tChoice\tI cannot find a reason this is included\tNo\nsys_dictionary\tDictionary\tDesign Choice - has a Class field and it's in use\tYes\nsys_filter\tFilter\tDesign Choice - has a Class field and it's in use\tYes\nsys_hub_action_type_base\tAction Type Base\tDesign Choice - has a Class field and it's in use\tYes\nsys_import_set_row\tImport Set Row\tDesign Choice - has a Class field and it's in use\tYes\nsys_portal_page\tPortal Page\tDesign Choice - has a Class field and it's not used\tNo\nsys_report_import_table_parent\tReport Import Table\tWhat does this table even do?\tNo\nsys_transform_map\tTransform Map\tI cannot find a reason this is included\tNo\nsys_transform_script\tTransform Map Script\tI cannot find a reason this is included\tNo\nsys_user_preference\tUser Preference\tI cannot find a reason this is included\tNo\nsysauto\tScheduled Job\tDesign Choice - has a Class field and it's in use\tYes\nsyslog\tSystem Log\tI cannot find a reason this is included\tYes\nMy thoughts on extending tables\nI can categorize my opinions about when and why to extend a table into three reasons.\n\nEdit: At the time I wrote this, there were two things I had not considered. One. Extending tables is really complicated.\n\nPros\tCons\nYou get all the fields from the parent\tYou get all the fields from the parent\nYou could add fields that may hit the limit of the technical length in SQL\nReporting on it can be difficult\nIf you need two records with the same unique value in the two tables, the system will not allow this\nTo extend some of these tables is uncharted waters and may not work well see sys_choice\nUsability\nAssuming you have a table in mind;\nDoes it make sense to have/modify a \"type\" or \"class\" field and have one the table?\nAlso, does the new type inherently change the the record that it is very different?\n\nIf yes to both, extend, if not make new.\n\nScoped Access\nSometimes you cannot create or read records that you might want to use in a scoped app, see sys_user_group.\nIn this case it may make sense to extend that table if you want to create/modify those records. This is a\ntechnical reason, and I feel they likely should not be extended still but must be.\n\nDesign Choice\nGenerally, something will automatically extend a table, like Import Set Row.\nAnytime you upload a new file as a data source that is extended.\n\nThis is done by adding a class field to indicate the class of record.\nSome records with this only ever have one class, like sys_auth_profile.\nSome have many like cmdb_ci, sys_user, and task.\n\nConfiguration items\nSometimes you gotta extend this to track things your work considers as a CI but ServiceNow has not. E.g. Rooms\n\nIn the example of Rooms, out-of-box there is a \"Computer Room\" CI class, but you may want to track conference rooms,\ndata closets, supply rooms, etc. In these cases in my opinion extending cmdb_ci makes sense.\n\nKnowledge\nKnowledge is an interesting table to have here.\nOn one hand you could argue some Knowledge articles should be typed/classd differently.\nI believe Knowledge already has this.\n\n\nFurther Reading: https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-servicenow-platform/page/product/knowledge-management/concept/knowledge-article-templates.html\n\nLocation\nLocation is an odd table to me to have on this list.\n\nI'm trying to imagine a situation where you might have different location types, e.g. Offices, Kiosks, and Datacenters\n\nIn these cases I can't imagine a situation you would need this extended. Now scoped apps cannot write to some common tables,\nif that is the reason this is here that may make sense. If a scoped app needs a place to write to that is like location, but different\nextend it and write to the extension. If that is the case though then I'd expect the same for Group Memberships\n\nWith all that being said, on initial look of the table, it does not sport a sys_class_name field.\nHowever it also has \"Extensible\" as false.\nIf you change \"Extensible\" to true, then BOOM, now there's a sys_class_name field.\nI'm still not sure I agree with the all the ideas of this.\nThat being said it seems like a Design Descision now. - Jace 2019-12-16\n\nImport Set Row\nThis is extended for each data source you upload, so I feel this is understandable.\n\nTransform Map Script\nI don't think this makes any sense. I can't imagine why this would be extended.\n\nTransform Map\nI don't think this makes any sense. I can't imagine why this would be extended.\n\nAuthentication Profile\nAction Type Base\nReport Import Table\nDictionary\nI don't think this makes any sense. I can't imagine why this would be extended.\n\nIt has a class and it's used but unless I can make a new field type (I thought that wasn't possible.)\n\nI dont see why this is a thing unless that is possible.\n\n\n\nChoice\nSystem Log\nI don't think this makes any sense. I can't imagine why this would be extended.\n\nUser Preference\nFilter\nI don't think this makes any sense. I can't imagine why this would be extended.\n\n\n\nPortal Page\nI don't think this makes any sense. I can't imagine why this would be extended.\n\n\n\nScheduled Job\nThese are already extended to a number of types of jobs, but I'm not sure why I'd extend it.\n\nSysauto I extended all the time. Specifically sysauto_script for many integrations.\nIncluding the SCCM integration that is close to what we have today.\nAnd I used that same design for the all the integrations for security vulnerability. - @killswitch\n\nData Lookup Definition\nData Lookup Matcher Rules\nState Flow\nThis has a class, but just one. I'm not sure why this would be extended.\n\nExecution Plan Task\nThese are old as dirt.

With London we got the Multi-Row Variable Sets, and sure they also have their flaws, they are not as bad as List collectors.\n\nIn my past the most common use for List collectors is to grant access or to modify a number of things in different ways. The problem with that is, you can't specify after you've selected all the things what you want to do individually. So in practice, it would be a User Access form. You pick the users you want to change access for, but then you are only allowed to add one role, or group.\n\nCovestic's workaround\nThis is a great way to do the options without a whole table.. but then someone still has to manage these options.3\n\nOn your catalog item, create a new multiple choice or select box variable (either will work, we are after the \"Choices\" related list here), give it a name and some question text and then submit.\nAdd any choices your variable needs.\nSwitch the variable type over to a list collector. You will notice that we cannot save until we give ServiceNow a table to reference so pick Question Choice [question_choice]\nAdd a reference qualifier of \"question=XXXX\" where XXXX is the question’s sys_id.\n(Optional) You may want to deactivate the \"Question Choice Related List\" client script or modify the if statement in the script to be if (newValue == \"3\" || newValue == \"5\" || newValue == \"21\") to show the Question Choice related list on list collector variables.\nYou now have a list collector variable without having to create a whole new table.\n(Optional) You can now think about adding variable attributes such as no_filter or glide_list to alter the variable’s appearance on the form.\nComments\nCheriEmm commented on Jan 2, 2020\n\nOnly admins can see question_choice so this is useless for your end users. You could create an ACL but would have to think on the reason question_choice is only available to admin, etc.\n\njacebenson commented on Jan 2, 2020\n\nIt is a workaround.

I'm going to update this as needed but this is what I have so far.\n\nEmail is an amazing system, however, it is also easy to lose so much work there. ServiceNow wants you to make work you do from email into structured data that can easily worked.\n\nThat's great Jace, but where's the steps. What do I do?\n\nThe guide\nThis is all theory for me as I have not implemented this.\n\nStep 1\nIdentify what is going to be allowed now to create work.\n\nGo over you're current Inbound Actions and make a list of inbound emails you intend to still process immediately, initially I'd guess that is just the \"Update Approval Request\" inbound action.\n\nThe rest of them, ensure they set \"Contact Source\" to email for inserts.\n\nStep 2\nIdentify what outbound Notifications can be disabled right now.\nThe less you email people, the less they have to respond to.\nYou have many notifications that are not actionable.\nAnything that the user receiving the message is only informational should be disabled.\n\nDisable any notification that is strictly informational.\n\nExamples;\n\nItem Requested\nIncident Created\nSomething was approved\nStep 3\nNow it will get hard.\nChange processes on how people find work.\nInstead of going to their mailbox, they will need to go to their assignments.\n\nI'd recommend doing this all at once.\n\nNotes\nTL; DR Record Producers created specific to your most commonly reported incidents that gather the data needed to resolve those incidents (including optional data based on answers in the RP) can greatly reduce your TTR and cause overall greater customer satisfaction despite the bigger hurdle to incident submission.\ncareful pushing of folks to these Structured Record Producers can be handled in many ways, including closing incidents submitted improperly and pointing them to the new RP\n\nEmails & SP:\nEmails created entries cost more, introduce delay for most interactions, initial send is quicker for user to send, slower to help them in general case\nStructured data and clear services via SP are a large difference - cuts down on back and forth, aids in automation, helps routing and fulfillment expectations, transparency and prioritization. Better expectations and up front data collection leads to happier users quickly.\n\nPhased Approach is recommended Show incentive to go to no inbound email with Time to resolved Time to resolved is

Service Portal will no longer get updates by the Orlando release. It will be like Workflow, Execution plans, Homepages, and the Content Management System. It will still work but will not get future development.\n\nI know it's only been out since Helsinki and that means since April 2016 which is ~4 years. But after you look at these findings, you'll agree.\n\nWhy bring it up?\nWell, I don't like to work on something that isn't going to get support. Things that do not get active development generally are left behind.\n\nThey are hard to maintain because any new features need to be built by the customers using them. Want to see some active examples?\n\nNew Feature\tNew Feature last notable update\tOld Feature\tOld Feature last notable update\nDashboards\tNew York: Multiple Breakdowns\tHome pages\tHomepage layouts (Summer '08)\nFlow Designer\tNew York: Multiple Updates\tWorkflow\tCreated Workflow (Summer '08)\nService Portal\tNew York: Agent Chat\tCMS\tCreated CMS (Summer '09)\nWould ServiceNow keep development efforts on Service Portal and the New Design System? Unlikely.\n\nIn the past they haven not ever announced they would od this kind of dual development. According to this talk all out of box forms will use these components that are part of this.\n\nWhat is the New Design System?\nBefore we dive into what this is, lets talk about why it's needed.\n\nKeeping ServiceNow tied to Angular 1.5.3 is not maintainable.\nAny new functionality developed needs to be custom developed by someone to use in SN.\nNo ability to use new tech in the old system.\nSo, now that we know why it's needed, lets talk about the new design system.\n\nAt it's core everything is on a \"Canvas\". When you customize the canvas, it appears ServiceNow is calling that an \"Experience\" and Pre-defined experiences are called \"Workspaces\" which we've seen since Madrid (See Agent Workspace).\n\nSo to repeat;\n\nCanvas: Base building block for new design system. I'd compare this to a UI Page.\nExperience: A name for a customized Canvas.\nWorkspace: A Experience with navigation and general UI components.\n\n\n\n\nHow is the design System built?\nServiceNow has not made that clear, but they did say it's all built on Jelly, then said, \"Just Kidding\". I am not sure.\n\nThe ServiceNow UI Framework is a custom Javascript framework built using web components. On top of that framework is the metadata layer.\n\nBased on web components stardard: custom elements + shadow DOM is what this is based on\nWrite testable, re-usable effects that respond to actions\nShared effects: all your platform API calls, no more messy spaghetti code These are custom to SN\nEverything is a component, and that's great\nOne target stack with customization and composition built into core.\nThere are two kinds of components;\n\nExperience Components - These are a UI and effects to connect to the platform API\n\n\n\nBase Components - UI only building blocks\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does it work together?\n\n\n\nWhat will this look like\nIn the video they actually create a widget using web components for ServiceNow.

Before that, I'm not sure how ServiceNow secured their tables as it was before my time.\n\nI've been asked in the past to remove the message \"n records removed by security...\" and it can be done, but shouldn't.\n\nHere's my take on it.\n\nAccess Control Lists (aka ACLs) are there for two reasons;\n\nmaintainability\nsecond is field level control\nYou could replace every tables Access Control Lists with Query Business Rules. That is not the normal place security is generally configured.\n\nHere's some very insightful quotes from people I respect on the topic and links to the resources;\n\ngflewis asked in 2011\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of using an Access Control verses a Before Query Business Rule to block certain users from reading certain records? As far as I can tell, the functionality appears to be identical.\n\nCapaJC responded in 2011\n\nBefore query is highly preferable if you can use one. It makes the database do the work by modify the query itself. With Contextual Security, your instance has to decide per record what a user can see after fetching them from the database.\n\nWith a before query rule, unavailable records are simply not there as far as the user is concerned. With Contextual Security they might get a list of 4 visible records, and the list might say 1 to 100 of 546 with a message at the bottom saying \"96 records removed due to security constraints\".1\n\nMore recently Tim W. wrote in 2018\n\nACLs Vs Query Business Rules: ACLs, but also sometimes query business rules; but usually for performance reasons more than security.2\n\nFurther Reading;\n\n1 - [https://community.servicenow.com/community?id=community_question&sys_id=11a68365db1cdbc01dcaf3231f961976](Community Post from 2011)\n2 - [https://snprotips.com/blog/2018/9/18/broken-queries-and-query-rules](Tim W's Post from 2018)\nhttps://www.servicenowguru.com/scripting/business-rules-scripting/controlling-record-access-before-query-business-rules/\nhttps://www.servicenowguru.com/showcase/servicenow-security-tips/ #4\nComments;\n\n@jgr1ffin commented on Dec 3, 2019\n\nOne other thing worth nothing between the two is that QBR's can't perform top-level OR queries (^NQ).\n\njacebenson commented on Dec 3, 2019\n\n@jgr1ffin that is something I did not know. Thank you for sharing!\n\nmikebski commented on May 12, 2020\n\nAlso if you have lots of records you are filtering with ACLs you end up with empty pages in the UI - For example, I have 500 records and the user only has perms to see 5. If I use ACL for view they see 500 records worth of pages in the UI - in this case a BR is a must.\n\njared-laethem commented on May 23, 2020\n\nAnother difference is that ACL's can specify scripted conditions that may not be able to be expressed as a query.

Update Set Batches are amazing, until you have a problem.\n\nOne problem I've experienced with batching work in development is;\nHandling errors on update set batches.\nSometimes this is due to a missing plugin or some other update set that needs to wait. How do you correct this? With help from @paige and @ajb I will answer this;\n\nQuotes;\n\n... delete the previewed update sets (all of them, including parent). Remove it from the parent in the source instance and bring it all back over. - @paige\n\n... un-parent it, or as Paige said - delete the whole thing - and re-parent in development - @ajb\n\nWhen I've done the delete way in the past I've had issues and now reading through these comments I can guess why. You need to ensure you \"... have to ensure you get ALL the update sets.\" as @paige said. I suspect I didn't get all the update sets.\n\nGoing forward now that I've had success doing this are these steps;\n\nDelete the Target Instance Update Sets, & Batch Update set\nUn-parent in source\nRe-import\nCan issues still arise? Sure, keep this in mind;\n\nSo update sets can fail two ways in regards to batching;\n\nAn update set completed can be pulled before it's associated with a batch. If you want that to be included in the batch it needs to be removed from the target instance.\nAn update set was included but before applying it you want to exclude it.

My mind was blown. How did he do it.\n\nHis post doesn't go over the specifics but here's what he said;\n\nService Portal widget can also be used in ServiceNow native UI, all you need to do is just to create a UI Macro/formatter which loads a service portal page with that widget\n\nThe way to do this (again thanks to Andrew) is this;\n\nCreate an empty Service Portal (I'll name mine \"widgetOnly\")\nCreate a Portal Page (I'll name mine \"pageForHelloWorld\")\nAdd your widget to the Portal Page\nCreate a UI Macro (I'll name mine \"spHelloWorld\") with this code, change height as needed\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n<j:jelly trim=\"false\" xmlns:j=\"jelly:core\" xmlns:g=\"glide\" xmlns:j2=\"null\" xmlns:g2=\"null\">\n  <iframe src=\"widgetOnly?id=pageForHelloWorld\" width=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:none;min-height:400px;\">\n  </iframe>\n</j:jelly>\nCreate a UI Formatter with the formatter called \"spHelloWorld.xml\" and set the table you want.\nAdd the formatter on the form (same way you'd add a field, via form layout)\nComments\nartemis15 commented on May 6, 2020\n\nInstead to creating portal for this, you can alos use $sp.do?id=pag\n\njacebenson commented on May 6, 2020\n\nThat's a great call out. Thanks @artemis15 .\n\nnsierraj commented on May 13, 2020\n\nAnd you can use \"RP.getParameterValue('sys_id');\" to pass values to the widget to make it sensitive to the record in the form.\n\nmeatsac commented on Nov 1, 2020\n\nThis post suggests you can call the widget directly. I haven't had success with this myself but would be interested to hear if this is indeed

That was the error message I got. So working backwards I was troubleshooting this production issue. A service account I used to create a Certificate was failing because it's account was locked out. The only folks with access was me and my team. I've never met anyone who enjoys working with them and generally I took the lead. So I tried authenticating on the web to the Certificate Authorities website. Sure enough it asked me to change my password. At this point I knew one of two things needed happen.\n\nAutomate the password change\nAutomate a reminder to change the password\nI looked and looked at the APIs available to the service account but there was none to change the password. I asked the administrator if there was a way to exclude an account or some other automatic way to change the password and they shrugged and said no.\n\nDefeated I knew I at least had a great tool to remind myself and team to change the password frequently enough to avoid this again.\n\nScheduled Templates\nHaven't heard of them? They are OLD. Like pre-legacy workflow old.\n\nWhat you'll need\nTo use them you need three things.\n\nA template\nA user with rights (role: template_scheduler) to make a scheduled template\nA schedule template\nHow to make one\nWhen I do this I go and manually enter the data I want in the template on the record type I need.\nTurn on the template bar, create a new template.\nNow once you create the template you have to go to the template record (unfortunate, but out of box they hide the ui action from the form.) For now, we'll manually just go to the right place. In the filter of your navigation type sys_template.list. Open your template and you will see a schedule button, if you don't verify you have that template_scheduler role.\nAssuming you are on the schedule entity generation record, fill out the frequency you want this created.\nThat's it.\nMaking it available to more users\nA few weeks after I did this I was asked by someone at security how can they create a repeating task. So I gave 'em access to the scheduled template, made links to templates (sys_template) and scheduled templates (sysauto_template) if they have the template_scheduler role. Now anyone can solve this problem with a little help from our team.\n\nHow do they work?\nWhen you create a Scheduled Template, Servicenow creates a \"Schedule\" (sys_trigger) which is the same thing used for scheduled jobs, async business rules, inactivity monitors, sla calculations, metric events, upgrades and much more. It's not clear **how** it works under the hood but ServiceNow's doc's don't say much more. Dirk wrote about some of this but it's not well documented to I'd just be guessing.\n\nWhat about checklist templates?\nI had a note to talk about using checklists too but that's a bit much here.

Image by Markus Winkler from Pixabay \n23 Dec 2022 by Jace Benson\n\nIntroduction to AI/ML\nServiceNow's Artificial Intelligence (aka Predictive Intelligence) is complex and . and difficult to set up, and other people weren't impressed with it.\n\nI have this worm in my ear and I need to get it somewhere.\n\nEmbrace it or be left behind.\n\nWe fear what we don't understand, I hope my journey will help add some understanding. If it does, please let me know where you can find me.\n\nIn 2016 I read about Predictive Intelligence in ServiceNow. This wa my first real look at anything like this. I remember thinking this Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML) stuff looked awesome. It sounded very complicated and difficult to set up. Back then, you needed around 10,000 incidents to train it to assign tickets to the right group. That seemed painful. To keep it up to date, you had to re-train the cortex. I tell you this to emphasize that I walked away; it was too much.\n\nA while later MoveWorks demo'd their chatbot solution to me. It was also great. You'd message it something and it would ask you simple questions to either answer your question or submit a catalog request for you. I remember how it knows what catalog item or article to surface. They mentioned they train the bot based on the customers instance and weight the items. I didn't understand. I never got to use their product but I didn't understand they were using AI.\n\nUnderstanding AI/ML\nI saw a video by Veratisum on March 4th, 2022 about analog computers and it made sense. He showed how in the 60s they were assigning weights to 20x20 pixel images of dogs to have the Perceptron identify if an image was a dog or not.\n\nIt took a while but this video is what made it click for me. I understood the concept. Assign weight things and ask questions so the AI could respond. This had been in my head for months. Then I came across Stable Diffusion and decided to try it out on November 6th. It amazed me, making images of everything. I was paying attention to swyx.io and he had a timeline of how Open Source is eating AI. To put this into perspective, Stable Diffusion became a thing on September 7th. I looked into Text to Text AI generation, but all I found was Kobold AI which I set up, but it was beyond me. Everything else was too computationally expensive.\n\nThen ChatGPT came out. I was like many, impressed. I wanted to understand more and get Text to Text AI stuff running locally to try things. I hadn't read into OpenAI but I did later that day. One way I learn best is to try to make something. So I did that. I made a little button in ServiceNow to generate code for me. It was neat but I didn't think it would be useful to many. So I took inspiration from SN Utils' extension and started working on an extension. This was December 1st.\n\nDeveloping an Scribe.Monster\nI released my extension four days after making my OpenAI account. My first commit to https://scribe.monster was on December 5th.\n\nSince then, I've been consuming so much AI educational content.\n\nFine-tuning, Prompt engineering, one-shot, few-shot, and no-shot prompts. It's been a ride if you've been following along you likely have seen how the extension has changed.\n\nI don't know where this will take me, but AI that was inaccessible before is now accessible everywhere. People are using it in crazy novel ways; some of them are dangerous while others are profound. At the end of the day it is a tool, a very complicated autocomplete.\n\nI'd like to think this anti AI and pro AI stuff is like calculators. Back in the day, calculators weren't allowed for math work, but then they were, and things changed. People who grew up memorizing how to do math can still do it amazingly, but those with calculators now needed one to do math as fast. Like calculators, AI will be a tool, except AI isn't something one can do in their head. You can create a prompt and it will give you an answer, for better or worse.\n\nThe genie is out, and I don't see it being put back\nHere we are, at the end of this post. I hope it has helped you understand how I came to understand this stuff. For those who think AI is a fad and will go away, I disagree. I'm not in that group. It will stick around. Robert Fedoruk posted this on Linkedin;\n\n\"ChatGPT is out for days and has more popular appeal and use cases than BLOCKCHAIN. Edit: Full disclosure, just a good natured ribbing to my blockchain friends. I know there's some important stuff being worked on. Just showcasing how fast simple use cases scale.\"\n\nThat may have been posted in jest, but he's not wrong.

This day however Pheedbaq explained why this is a problem and why we shouldn't do it.\n\nHere's my understanding.\n\nLet's go with spatial bodies. For this example we'll extend sys_user to user_martian and user_plutonian.\n\nYou can create a user on user_martian, they will never hav a class of sys_user.\n\nIf you decide that later you want user_plutonian extension, users who were made on user_martian can never also exist on user_plutonian.\n\nLet's use an example. Let's say John is a new Citizen on Mars and moved there yesterday. You guys have a process that creates a user_martian record for him. Then you decided he's going to move to Pluto and work from the branch there.\n\nYou'd need a second record because his class cannot be both user_plutonian and user_martian.\n\nPheedbaq's message that spurred this\nIf you have: sys_user\n\ncontract_user extends sys_user\n\nsubsidiary_user extends sys_user\n\nThen you create Bob who is a contract_user\n\nBob's class will never be \"sys_user\".\n\nBob can never be a \"subsidiary_user\".\n\nTo make Bob both a contract_user and a subsidiary_user, Bob must have 2 accounts.\n\nThe User table should never be extended. We have had apps and guidance in the past that say \"extend sys_user\" and those are wrong. For ServiceNow-made apps which extend sys_user, those teams have already or are in the process of unwinding that so they don't break future customers. The documentation should hopefully already be cleaned up, but there may be some lingering bad advice out there.\n\nI didn't mean to interrupt the LCHH; I thought posting here would be non-disruptive.

The navigation shortcut of table.filter came up. I didn't know about it. It's great. Instead of writing about just that, I include all the shortcuts.\n\nServiceNow has 3 sets of shortcuts. They have UI15 Keyboard shortcuts. I'm not covering those as no one uses UI15 anymore.\n\nKeyboard shortcuts\nThere's only a few that ServieNow observes. Extensions add some too.\n\nOut of box shortcuts\nA thing to note, some of these are configurable\n\nAction\tWindows keyboard shortcut\tMac keyboard shortcut\nActivate global search field\tCtrl+Alt+G\tCtrl+Opt+G\nToggle application navigator\tCtrl+Alt+C\tCtrl+Opt+C\nActivate navigation filter field\tCtrl+Alt+F\tCtrl+Opt+F\nImpersonate user\tCtrl+Alt+I\tCtrl+Opt+I\nNavigate to the main content on the page\tCtrl+Alt+P\tCtrl+Opt+P\nJavascript Executor Window\tCtrl+Shift+J\tCtrl+Shift+J\nOn Service Portal id=form Save the form\tCtrl+S\tCtrl+S\nOn Service Portal widget editor, Save\tCtrl+S\tCtrl+S\nOn script editor fields, format code\tShift+Tab\tShift+Tab\nFrom SN Utils\nAction\tKeyboard shortcut\nSave the current form\tCtrl+S\nCreate List filter\tCtrl+Left Click on Field Label\nPaste screenshots\tCtrl+V\nActivate the extension\tConfigurable\nPop-In/Pop-Out of nav_to.do\tConfigurable\nShow Technical Names\tConfigurable\nOpen slashcommand popup\tConfigurable\nOpen VS Code ScriptSync tab\tConfigurable\nSource: https://twitter.com/sn_utils/status/1192913388906713088\n\nNavigation shortcuts\nServiceNow's docs on this are... well they say this same thing.

His post inspires this one. I am writing this down so those who follow me may see it.\n\nFor me this has always been \"get my mind in the interviewing mindset\" piece.\n\nI'll start this with a quote from another older post of mine;\n\nSo interviewing is exciting.\nIt's a way to get uncomfortable and see what is available in job-land.\nSomething to keep in mind, interviews are a way for you and your employer to find a great fit for this position.\n\nI enjoy interviewing, and some don't but this will help you navigate this time better.\n\nIf you read nothing else read this;\n\nSalary negotiations started as soon as you applied.\nSalary isn't the only thing being negotiated.\nIf you don't ask, the answer is always no.\nNever give the number first, if pressed, deflect, if you can't give a range.\nTake notes when researching and interviewing.\nUse your significant other or family to buy time and think about the offer.\nWhen does the salary negotiation start?\nSalary negotiations start the moment you apply for a job. So don't submit a number on any form when you apply. That gives them a heads up where to start.\n\nYou might be thinking, \"Jace, they need a number on the form. What do I put in there?\" Yea, they generally have that. Put $1. They know that can't be right.\nThis will start the dialog. That dialog is critical.\n\nYou should know about what your average pay range is. Be aware of the range of pay for your skills demand.\n\nAt this point you might also be wondering what can you expect that conversation to go like. For me I've always been able to use the line from Patrick's article, and I'm paraphrasing;\n\nI'm more concerned at the moment with talking to you about discovering whether we're a mutual fit.\nIf we're a great fit, then I can be flexible on the numbers with you and you can be flexible on the numbers with me.\n\nWhy negotiating matters\nMy first job into tech was help desk.\nThey paid me a few dollars more an hour than I made as hospital clergy.\nThen I got a jump on to actual tech work. I didn't know then what I know now.\nI would tell myself, \"Jace, you could ask for more.\nYou might not want to, but if you don't you wont know unless you get another job after.\"\n\nIf you don't ask the answer is always no.\nThat's something I've come to learn over time.\nThis is true with negotiating.\nIf the salary isn't up to your needs and you still want to spend more time checking out the offer.\nTake a few hours, or a few days and think about other benefits that are negotiable. Some ideas might be;\n\nPaid time off - Recurring expense\nSigning Bonus - One time expense\nRelocation Stipend - One time expense they can limit\nEquity/Stock options - A future expense that could be reduced over time\nFlexible work schedule - Costs nearly nothing\nI mean I never had any of success asking for these things but, you can't get those things if you don't ask.\nIf you're walking away anyways, then ask.\n\n\"Interesting\" is a wonderful word\nIt's positive and non-commital. They give you a number you can tell them it's interesting without giving the wrong impression.\n\nUsing a significant other and family can help buy time\nSaying things like \"This sounds great. Let me talk it over with the wife/husband.\" will buy you time. Time to consider and after a call I'm generally\nexcited willing to agree to most things.\n\nThe first rule is what everyone has told you: Never give a number first\nThis is true. When forced deflect. If you can't deflect, give a range. I don't think I have much more to add here.\n\nListen to what people tell you. Repeat it back to them.\nWhen you see the job posting there are key phrases they use. You should note and use them with the company. See if any of those phrases jive with things you did in the past or are remotely like it, own it.\n\nBring a notebook\nNothing stops you from bringing in a notebook to take notes while interviewing. Taking notes is important. I know my memory is my worst enemy. This is literally why I write this stuff down to better remember. Point is, write down the things they say that stand out. Those notes are great things to follow up on, and think about.\n\nResearch the company\nLook up the company, try to figure out how their lines of business. This helps frame what will be important to the business. I like to try to find who my co-workers might be ahead of time. Some sites offer past questions asked for the employer. I've never had success with those but it gives you an idea of what might be asked.\n\nThoughts and sources\nI just found the author at some point updated his post with a link to this great

Then did you ever look for it later and find it gone?\n\nI have. It's a terrible, terrible feeling. For me it was my Geocities site. Thinking back on it now, it was my ten year old me writing my thoughts and feelings. But it was mine.\n\nI know their was a project to save geocities content somehow, but for me, that site is long gone.\n\nThere's other things like this. A lot of my early work on ServiceNow also is gone. Not because the code is gone. I assume those solutions are still on those instances.\nBut, my access to those are gone, my reasons for those solutions are gone. If I've learned anything about other peoples platforms, it's that you can't trust they will be there forever.\n\nIf you want that level of security, you need to always own your platform.\n\nWhy should you own your own content\nSimple. When it's yours, you have ultimate control of it's distribution.\nIf you post it on Facebook, you are conceding to the fact that users have to also be on Facebook.\nIf you post it on ServiceNow's community, you're giving up things like;\n\ncanonical URL\nsocial media image control\nthe ability to see traffic via Google Analytics, Plausible, or Clicky\nDon't get me wrong. ServiceNow isn't going away anytime soon. Since I've worked with them their community has had at least three versions. With each one, some things were never saved when they moved.\n\nIf you blog about whatever, you should host it yourself.\n\nThe easiest way to do that is with the JAMStack.\n\nHow do I get started\nOk Jace, I'm in, how do I get started?\n\nShort answer: click this link to deploy a site to Netlify for free.\nLonger answer;\n\nSo there is some set up, however if you've been doing any scoped app development, it's literally a click away. No joke. I'm a big fan of Netlify. They have a site with templates and everything to get started. This site, as it is now uses Hugo. I'm working on moving to 11ty. If you're getting started, I'd go to Phil Hawksorth's github repository for eventyone, and click\n\nJace, I don't like Javascript!\nOkay, okay there's tons of generators.\n\nHugo uses Go.\nGatsby uses React.\n11ty uses javascript.\nEach one has it's pros and cons. I've used all of these. Effectively they are the same.\n\nWhat else can I do with one of these sites\nLots of things. You know that news.jace.pro site I have. Yep, that is actually built daily using this stuff. The code feels ugly but it works. I plan to move it around a bit, but that's a more complicated thing you can do.

I cannot begin to know the worry they have.\n\nThese are terrible times. I wish you all best, but every time I try to get involved getting someone a gig or job things go sideways fast. So I stopped doing that. Now I just tell people... the stuff below. That's why I'm writing this. So I can share it use it to cover all the things.\n\nSince March I've been watching slack cautiously. Reading about lay offs and furloughs.\n\nI encourage everyone in this space to listen to Robert Fedoruk and CJ Wesley's podcast featuring Kyle Carson.\n\nThoughts on getting a job working on ServiceNow\nFirst you need to land an interview. To do that, make an amazing resume. Some say a resume isn't important, some say it is. I like my resume and trying to make it look good, but it's a weird thing. A piece of paper listing skills, history, accomplisments and why you want to work there.\n\nResumes are the tickets to interviews\nThere's lots of things online about resumes. I don't have concrete evidence on what works and what doesn't, so I'll share my thoughts from my experience.\n\nI have a \"Base\" resume I keep up to date with all my experience and such, and I make copies of it tailored to companies needs.\n\n1. Keep it current.\tUpdate that resume anytime you get a job with the tasks or skills they list.\n2. Don't lie.\tIt's easy to lie, not so easy to get away with it. I wouldn't want to hire a liar.\n3. Describe creatively.\t\"Handled integrations.\" becomes, \"Saved 5 hours per week per person automating ServiceNow to Payroll feeds.\"\n4. Know your skills.\tAn admin and a developer can look the same on paper.\n5. Clean up your social media.\tIf they look you up, you don't want controversial things coming up.\n6. Know your resume.\tBE READY TO SPEAK ON EVERY THING YOU PUT ON THE RESUME.\n7. Make it personal.\tTailor the resume to the job. Use their lingo from their job posting.\n8. Quantify your successes.\tNumbers will find attention.\n9. Enlist your community.\tShare the details where you help others and they help you.\n10. Pair your resume down.\tBe concise. This isn't an biography.\nYou should update your resume per position applied. Show your best sides to the potential employer. I've done this but not every time.\n\nInterviews are just conversations to give and get information\nSo since I'm still loving Hamilton I'm going to try something new;\n\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine... It's the ten jobby commandments.\n\n1. Focus and elevate.\tKnow your worth and expect it.(I read this to get there. Every. Single. Time).\n2. Ready questions for people.\tScreening call: benefits, culture, company expectations. Interview: team, and technical specifics.\n3. Apply to at least three places.\tOne you don't want work at, and the rest you do. Practice with the \"don't\" place.\n4. Take notes.\tWrite down notes during the all interview steps. You won't regret it, and then you'll have it to reference later.\n5. Research. Research. Research.\tUnderstand the goals of each company. What their lines of business are, and consider would you fit in there.\n6. Never give a number first.\tGoal: Verify you want to work here and if they want to hire you a lot. When that's true, numbers are flexible.\n7. Listen and repeat.\tUse keywords from the job posting, and use them where appropriate.\n8. Money isn't everything.\tIt's important. Some places can't offer you what you need. Consider negotiating extra time off then.\n9. \"Interesting\" is a great word.\tThem: We can offer you 80k. You: 80k is interesting.

Here's how to get started\n05 Dec 2020 by Jace Benson\n\nWhy Blog\n\nGetting started\n\nThe logical workflow\nActually making the content\nLet me know if you set one up I'd love to follow along\n\nHelp me help you. Leave your future self notes.\n\nI do this via this blog. I think this is a great way to do this.\n\nWhy Blog\nI blog to keep notes of code I work on, and make them available for others. It's my way of saving me from myself. It's also my way of sharing what I've done. Others seem to find it useful, to win win. Also writing down my thoughts, means I have to at least understand it enough to talk about it. There's loads of reasons folks choose to blog.\n\nOther benefits to do this privately or publicly.\n\nReasons to create content\n\nReason\tPublicly\nAttract an Audience\t✅\nEstablish Authority\t✅\nBuild Rapport and Engagement\t✅\nOrganize Your Thoughts and Learn\t✅\nTell Your Story\t✅\nMeet New People\t✅\nStand Out\t✅\nValidate Expertise\t✅\nGet into the habit of writing more\t✅\nUse the blog as a case study reference\t✅\nShare your perspective\t✅\nIf you're convinced but not sure where to start keep reading.\n\nGetting Started\nThere's two sides of this.\n\nLots of places talk about each seperately. I'm going to tackle both here.\n\nThere's the side of how to manage the ideas that become pieces. I think of this as the logical workflow.\nThere's the side of how to actually organize the data.\nThis is my opinionated guide to get started. I've worked with most of the tools used over the years.\n\nMy preference is Git(Github or Gitlab) and Netlify.\n\nYou generally have three artifacts after you set this up.\n\nA place to store ideas and drafts\nA place to store posts\nA domain\nA domain is nice. They have a annual cost but generalyl they are pretty inexpensive.\n\nBy choosing Github and Netlify you should have no extra cost.\n\nThe logical workflow\nYou have an question or idea. You don't know the answer but you would like to and think I might look that up. Write it down as an idea.\nWhen you have time, review your ideas and start researching the question.\nOnce you're comfortable with the topic, create the post. Make sure you verify the content.\nSometimes I start writing but often I will start with an idea.\n\nBy tracking this backlog of ideas you can let those thoughts go. You can comeback to them and work them little at a time. Writing is hard. Don't make it harder than it has to be.\n\nActually making the content\nI use 11ty for my blog. I think it's great. I've made a template of my blog for you. Really.\n\nHere's what I like about how Jace-ty works.\n\nA folder for each post lets you organize your assets for each post with the text.\nBuild times are fast because 11ty is fast.\nSearch is important and included.\nRSS feeds are great to let people read where they want to read.\nFast load times are important because no one wants a slow blog.\nYou get all that by pressing this button.\n\nDeploy to Netlify\n\nWhat happens when you press that button.\n\nNetlify will ask for permission to Github so it can create a repository for you.\nNetlify will link the repository with their system so they can build the files on update.\nWhat do you do after that?\n\nUpdate the ./src/_data/site.js file with your details. The template files use this data to show your information.\nStart creating content.\nTo create a Post look at the three sample posts in ./src/post/\nEdit the post index.md. It starts with frontmatter. The content of the post is below the frontmatter.\nEach post has two images.\nfeatured.jpg is the image shown on the post when you go to the page.\nfeatured-thumbnail.jpg is the image shown in footer for the last 4 posts, and also on the /posts of your site.\nYou may have done those edits on Github. I prefer to do this locally. Here's how to get started;\n\ngit clone git@github.com:YOURUSERNAME/jace-ty.git my-blog #clones the code made from above\ncd my-blog # goes into the cloned directory\nyarn #installs dependencies for this\ncode . #opens vs code to this directory\nyarn serve # this starts serve the site on 8081 ctrl-c stops this\nNow as you edit the files locally you can see them change on your localhost:8081\n\nCopy one of the other posts folder, update the folder name, and the content. Replace the images\n\nOnce you're done making content, lets deploy that up to github.\n\n# from cloned directory my-blog\ngit add . # stages all the modified files commit\ngit status # shows you whats

It's way longer than I had hoped but there's just so many ways to set up this and I didn't even hit all the features.\n\nThis feature will save me time.\nThis will take work out of my backlog and enable non-admins to create catalog items for predefined templates.\nCreating the templates takes some thought ahead of time. Thankfully, I've thought about this a lot in the past. See \"The Nine Standard Workflows\" from Robert Fedoruk's Titans of Now series.\nThis utility doesn't do anything special with update sets or scopes. Do you have to have the \"Catalog Builders\" build in dev? No. Should you? I'm not sure.\nThere didnt appear to be any approval process to get these items published.\nThis has some limitations, but they seemed pretty minor to me.\nGetting started\nI jumped in without looking at the docs and didn't seem to have much trouble, there's a lot here. I'll lay out the logical steps here.\n\nBefore you can even try this as a \"Catalog Builder\", you need a template. This isn't the templates I'm used to in ServiceNow. This template lets users control most options about the item. Here's the link to limitationsits on the lower half of the page.\n\nLimitations\n\"Catalog builder does not allow creation and editing of the following entities, but they can be set in Now Platform either for a draft item or a published item that has not been checked out.\"\nServiceNow Docs\n\nCatalog Item limitations\n\nCan't set meta tags\nCan't use execution plans\nCan't deal with prices\nVariable limitations\n\nCan't set Help Text\nCan't set default value\nNot all variable types are available here. Most are, but some are not, notible, List Collectors, and Macros are missing.\nDoesn't allow editing variables with two levels of containers.\nLogic limitations\n\nCatalog Client Scripts are not available.\n\nData lookup rules (maybe ref. qualifier)\n\nCatalog UI policy (Source: AAtrey)\n\nOn Load field (defaults to true)\nScript field. When a catalog UI policy has a script, it does not show up in the question’s behavior settings list in the catalog builder.\nReverse if false field. By default, it is set to true.\nMultiple actions. When a catalog UI policy has multiple actions, it does not show up in the question’s behavior settings list in the catalog builder.\nCreating a template\nA heads up, all the choices here can be overridden on a granular basis. So you'll probably want to be more permissive then restrictive here.\n\nThere's 8 sections to these templates. Here's the official docs on this, but I'll spell it out here too.\n\nTemplate Details\nTemplate name and short description are details available when looking at the templates.\n\nTemplate available for, dictates who can use this template.\n\nDetails\nItem Name, Short description, Image, and Description will be set based on these for the \"Catalog Builder\". If you want the \"Catalog Builder\" to come up with those details, you should leave them blank.\n\nLocation\nThese catalogs and categories are the items unless you allow editing this in the overrides.\n\nQuestions\nQuestions only allow you include variable sets. Variables added this way cannot be removed from the item. The set can be rearranged. Here is also where you can limit the kinds of variables available.\n\nSettings\nSettings allows you to control the \"Add to cart\", \"Add to wishlist\", \"Quantity\", \"Hide Delivery Time\", \"Hide Attachment\", \"Make attachment mandatory\", and the \"Submit button label\".\n\nAccess\nAccess is controlled strictly by User Criteria. This allows for granting and limiting by User Criteria.\n\nFulfillment\nThe fulfillment can get set to a workflow or flow designer. If you want to\n\nOverrides\nThis is where the \"Catalog builder\" can override the allowed options.\n\nCreating an item\nAfter overrides above you're done making the template. This means the \"Catalog builder\" now can use the template to make an item.\n\nThey can pick the template you made and set the overrides you allows and also add any number of questions here.\n\nProblems I ran into\nMaking available for and not available for mandatory means they will have to set at least one user criteria in each\nThey cannot edit variable sets you've added but they can add them themselves\nThey cannot edit the order within the variable sets\nJace's review\nWill this get used?

Steve: Yes.\n\nBefore Related Record Conditions on reports this was a really tough ask. I remember asking coworkers to jump into a room so we could flesh this out. It wasn't easy. There was 24 events this way. So we had 24 different scripted solutions watching for the lack of a check in.\n\nIn retrospect I wonder why I didn't just have a scripted end point update the server or something. However that's not why I'm writing this.\n\nDid you know you can easily get a list of records where theres no related records. No? Neither did I.\n\nHere's a few great use cases for this.\n\nFind me groups with no members (Can they be removed?)\nFind me catalog items with no related requests (Is this item being used?)\nFind me users with no related (If they are licensed can we remove them from those groups?)\nFind me notifications, with no email logs (Is this notification being triggered?)\nTo make report like this all you need to do is the following.\n\nBuilt your filter on the list your curious about. (e.g. Users)\nRight click on a column that has \"Bar Chart\", press that.\nIn your filter, click \"Related List Conditions\", and pick the related records you want to query. Say you want to find users where they are not a member of any group. (Or maybe users where they are a member of more then 3 groups)\nClick the \"Greater then or Equal to 1\" to change the related list condition.\nPick the Related List Condition table. (sticking with group memberships, you'd pick Groups)\nRelated list condition in ServiceNow\n\nOne really cool thing about this is if you click on the report you can see how the related condition is built in the URL condition which means you can also use these in encoded queries.

I mean you could argue they do, but we know those are only for folks with access to support.\n\nBefore the docs site and developer site became what it is today they used MediaWiki. (RIP Wiki).\n\nNow they use Zoomin for docs.servicenow.com\n\nI have often wondered why ServiceNow wants to know who you are when you're looking at the docs. They can get traffic data with something like Google Analtyics.\n\nI think this comes back to something ServiceNow is embracing more and more. Picking the right solution for the job. ServiceNow doesn't have a great api and release management suite. At least not a public one. So they've used Zoomin.\n\nAs much as I'd like them to use a static site generator for this that's not their perogitive.\n\nI've my own version as I've been bitten by their docs going down when I needed the most. Maybe we should collectively create one. I know there's times I wish their docs had things they don't. You can leave feedback (if the site is up).\n\nThe other thing I can't stand about their implementation of Zoomin is they drop off the old versions of ServiceNow.

From ServiceNow’s earliest days, listening to customers was far more than a bullet point in a mission statement. As ServiceNow founder Fred Luddy says, “we look to customers for inspiration—it’s the foundation of the company.”\n\nIn an interview on stage with ServiceNow CEO and president John Donahoe, Luddy highlighted light-bulb moments that drove ServiceNow’s growth, the new technology challenges facing businesses today, and the lesson he learned that started it all—having empathy for people and their jobs before you build technology for them.\n\nDonahoe: We know that founder and origin stories are an important part of every company. Can you share the story of how you founded ServiceNow?\n\nLuddy: I was 17 and working at American Standard. I’d created an order entry system for them at a time when clerks would carry around these big piles of paper for data entry. One morning a woman named Phyllis, a data entry clerk, said to me, “Watch what I’m doing.” I did and said, “Yeah, the system seems to be working as designed.” Which is what a 17-year-would say—you think you’re the repository of all human knowledge at that age.\n\nShe said, “Watch carefully. I’m typing the same stuff over and over again. If I could recall the prior data, and I could change the variances, I could get through this stack of papers 10 times faster.” So I showed her another technique for doing the data entry and she tried it. Then she did something quite unexpected: She cried. The burden had been lifted.\n\nI would never again approach a user with the notion that I knew more about what they were doing than they did. That was the most important lesson of my career—the idea of developing empathy for people and their jobs before you develop technology for them.\n\nDonahoe: There’s that notion of being willing to listen to customers, which is so important to us at ServiceNow. What was it like at the first Knowledge event?\n\nLuddy: Around the time that my brother and I were getting our first few sales, someone said we needed to have a user group. I thought it might be a little premature, but it sounded like fun. We rented a room, and all of the sudden registrations started to come in. It was really fun to have people come and share their time and tell us how they were using the technology.\n\nDonahoe: You said this was when the notion of customers teaching customers came to you. And we see this at Knowledge—90 percent of our sessions are customers talking to other customers.\n\nLuddy: That’s been part and parcel of Knowledge since the first one. We’d rather listen than talk. Software companies don’t really experience challenges firsthand. We only see them through our customers’ eyes. But when customers talk to each other, more ideas come out. It becomes much more organic.\n\nGet Workflow in your inbox\n\nWe give a lot of credit to customers for the features and functionality that have been put into our product. We look to customers for inspiration—it’s the foundation of the company.\n\n\n\nDonahoe: In my own keynote, I talked about how we’re at a tipping point with the changing work experience. Talk about where we are at work today, and where things are going.\n\nLuddy: There’s still far too much complexity baked into processes. People are reluctant to deal with it. The inflection point will be forced by workers. If you have teenage kids, you can’t imagine throwing them into the work experience of even just last year. Not only is that generation not going to accept it, they’re going to go to another company that provides that delightful experience. So unless your experience at work surpasses the experience at home, it will be very hard to attract talent.\n\nWe need to mask the complexity that’s below the line with simplicity above the line. When you do that, everyone benefits. People are more productive, and they’re happier.\n\nDonahoe: Another place where there’s change is the role of IT. What do you see as IT’s next phase?\n\nLuddy: As we become dependent on more and more services, I think IT becomes more important. Every time we’ve had one of these culture shifts, like PCs and BlackBerries and iPhones, people said IT would no longer be important. But every time the IT death knell has been sounded, it’s always been premature.\n\nWe always fall back on IT. I think of their role as the nexus for all of the technology in an organization. They have an intimate understanding of every facet of the business.\n\nDonahoe: What is your advice to today’s IT leaders?\n\nLuddy: For the longest time, it was hard for me to admit I didn’t know something. What changed my life was realizing it was OK to ask. It was about developing that user empathy, about listening to people and their challenges.\n\nMy advice would be to develop humility and ask questions.

We'll explain what UI policies are in relation to your form display, the benefits of UI policies, and go through a quick tutorial on how to create one. \n\n\nWhat is UI Policy \nUI policy in ServiceNow allows you to change and modify how fields on a form are displayed. Using conditions, you can set your field to be hidden, make them mandatory, or set them to read-only. Before we jump into creating a UI policy, let's go ahead and take a look at our incident form. Suppose you’ve been given a set of requirements that are dependent on our category field being set to software. The first requirement is to set the service field to mandatory, the second is to make the configuration item field read-only, and lastly, we are to hide the contact type field. \n\n\nMeeting Requirements with a UI Policy \nLet's go ahead and take a look at how we can meet those requirements with a UI policy. Looking at our new record form, we'll go ahead and populate the necessary information. This UI policy will be applied to the incident table; we'll go ahead and populate the short description. For when to apply, we’ll go ahead and set the condition where the category is software, and we'll go ahead and leave everything else to their default settings and hit submit. \n\n\nMaking Field Changes \nNow that we've applied conditions to our UI policy, the next step is to make those field changes. To do so, we'll create new UI policy actions that can be found in the related list of our UI policy. We'll go ahead and create a new record and set the field name to service. We'll make the mandatory true and submit this record. At a glance, we're looking at a UI policy where the condition category is software, the field change that we want to make is the service field, and we want to make that true. To confirm that this has taken place, we'll go ahead and make a test run. \n\n\nMaking a Test Run \n\nWe will test this out by reloading our form. As you can see now that the category is set to software, the service field is now set to mandatory. If you change this field, the service field is no longer set to mandatory. We'll go ahead and make the other field changes by creating new UI policy actions (reference video at 3:05). \n\n\nNow that we've created our three UI policy actions, which sets those field changes, we'll go ahead and make a test. We've refreshed our incident form, and as we can see, the category is software, our service field is now set to mandatory, our configuration item field is set to read-only, and our contact type field is now hidden. When we change the category field, we see that they've all been reversed back to their original settings, so service is now no longer mandatory, and so on and so forth. We've created our UI policy with the related UI policy actions to make those field changes. \n\n\nSome may wonder: couldn't we have done this with a client script? Well, we could have, but some of the benefits of using a UI policy in lieu of a client script include the use of the order field, which you can see in the advanced view, it's defaulted to 100. If you have multiple UI policies, the order field will allow you to control the order in which your policies take place. The next benefit is low to no code; if you have simple logic occurring on your form, UI policies allow you that option to build your conditions without having to code.

But just as Leone had predicted that the company would get to $10 billion, the ServiceNow team saw they could become much, much bigger. Why just service IT departments? ServiceNow's software and reputation meant it could branch out into other areas, from customer service to human resources.\n\nAnd Luddy had set the tone. Just as Luddy didn't think he could help the company grow past its early stages, Slootman realized that moving deeper into other areas like human resources and security meant ServiceNow needed a different CEO. Last year the company hired former eBay chief John Donahoe, with Luddy kicking himself upstairs from chief product officer to chairman, set to take effect this month.\n\nJohn Donahoe most certainly doesn't have an IT background: Before eBay, where he paid particular attention to PayPal, he was the CEO of the consulting giant Bain. But he has a grander vision of the same eureka moment that Luddy had 15 years ago: the need to make complex processes elegant and simple. \"Millennials say, Why can I reset my PayPal password in 20 seconds, but to reset my work email takes 20 minutes and a phone call?\" Donahoe says. \"Consumers want one seamless experience, and employees are the same way.\"\n\nSo Donahoe is taking ServiceNow's networked, easy-to-use IT support system to every corner of an enterprise. Internally called \"emerging products,\" these services help connect every department—from human resources and security to customer service, marketing, legal, finance and facilities—to one shared online database where an organization can analyze and take action on information.\n\"This is not technology in service of technology\"\n— CEO JOHN DONAHOE\nThe goal: quintuple sales to $10 billion by becoming the always-on engine behind an employee's work life, from the moment he or she is hired. ServiceNow last year launched a mobile app that handles the complete journey from employees' onboarding through their day-to-day work, relocation, leaves of absence and off-boarding. In a single app employees can find information like where your desk is, who your co-workers are and maps of the office; send questions to their staff coordinator; and address payroll questions and IT issues. In Donahoe's view, getting a new desk phone installed should be just as easy as hailing an Uber or chatting on Snapchat.\n\n\"This is not technology in service of technology,\" Donahoe says. \"We want to enhance the quality of the lives of people at work, whether you're an IT help-desk professional or an end user.\" That's not just providing a pretty interface. \"They call it employee experience, but to me it's productivity,\" says Josh Bersin, who runs an eponymous consultancy within Deloitte. \"I don't want an enjoyable experience to renew my 401(k). I just want to do it in one click.\"\n\nIn pivoting, Luddy and Donahoe are competing with a more agile group, which includes Salesforce, Microsoft, IBM and Workday. ServiceNow's sole advantage: the ability to upsell, leveraging its IT-service dominance to layer on related products. Donahoe boosted sales and marketing costs more than 30% last year.\n\nThe spending has generated results. ServiceNow projects about $2.4 billion in 2018 subscription revenue, and while the majority of that will still come from growth in the IT side, the \"emerging\" categories are expected to make up at least a third of new annual contract value this year, up from less than 20% at the beginning of last year. The opportunity presented by these offshoot verticals, estimated at $34 billion by Credit Suisse analyst Brad Zelnick, is even larger than the overall cloud-based IT market, which is about $27 billion.\n\nThe next step across all these areas: Use algorithms to take all these requests, data points and checklists and predict needs, flag concerns and measure efficiency. Rather than just streamline service, the company wants to improve automation and analytics through AI. Many innovations come from third-party app builders. (Clients have built about 35,000 custom apps, for example, to track security incidents like shoplifting and broken windows in a retail store, or to track the status of endangered animals in a park.) And much of the growth is expected to come from AI. Last January, ServiceNow spent $15 million to acquire DXContinuum, which is used throughout ServiceNow's cloud platform to help customers build predictive models that make it easier to categorize incoming requests. In May, ServiceNow bought the AI startup Parlo for its technology in natural-language understanding, which the company plans to inject into its core platform to help customers build intelligent business apps, complete with easy-to-create service catalogues, notifications and assignment tools.\n\nNone of this means Luddy has let his company lose it roots. His no-frills practicality still manifests itself at ServiceNow's Santa Clara headquarters, which are tidy and sunny but whose manicured trees and outdoor fountains are modest compared to the exaggerated play areas and flashy design of the campuses of Facebook and Apple. When asked to pick a lunch spot recently in his San Diego hometown, the billionaire chose Rudy's Taco Shop, which reminds its customers that shirts and shoes must be worn inside. Luddy, who now finds more time for tennis and his ten-year-old son, was wearing jeans and sneakers. \"The last six years have been like this beautiful dream,\" he says later at his beach house,

His father was an accountant; his mother, a Catholic-school teacher. The young Luddy was, by his own account, an indifferent student, but he was fascinated by machines and took apart everything he could get his hands on. At 17, while working as a gofer at American Standard, he saw an HP computer being installed in the office and begged to use it. With the help of programming guides (and the scarcity, in New Castle in 1972, of anyone with any coding knowledge), Luddy got himself hired as a programmer there ten days later.\n\nHis first insight into the power of software to make people's lives better came soon after. He wrote an order-entry program so the company clerk didn't have to keep typing up folding-door order forms with the same information all day. \"There is no better experience,\" he says, remembering that moment, \"than giving someone a piece of technology that lets them do something they never thought they could do.\"\n\nAfter dropping out of Indiana University (he spent all his time programming instead of going to class), he headed to Silicon Valley and the Amdahl Corp., an early competitor to IBM in the high-end mainframe-computer market.\n\nEven as Peregrine was imploding, Luddy hit on a revolutionary idea he had learned from three decades of programming: As the company's name suggests, he'd deliver office services over the internet, on a subscription basis (monthly, per customer), updated easily without requiring customers to manually download software from disks on different operating systems. As this was 2003, Luddy proved to be a software-as-a-service pioneer, pushing a user-friendly interface designed for the average office worker. Luddy's younger brother Rob (who had also worked at Peregrine) came on board in 2005 as the company's first sales representative, and they took the product to market.\n\nThe market's response: \"Meh.\"\n\n\"We had this really great, simple platform for creating workflows, and we would go to people and say, Hey, you can do all these things with this, and they just weren't interested,\" recalls Luddy, who at one point sold a car to make payroll. \"So we went back and said, Okay, we say this is this great tool for doing things like IT-support management, so why don't we back that up and make an IT-support product?\" This time the market bit.\n\nFred Luddy at his beachfront home in Del Mar, California. Success has meant more time to spend with his 10-year-old son and to work on his next project: making U.S. healthcare more affordable and efficient.\nIn July 2005, ServiceNow raised its first funds, a $2.5 million Series A round led by JMI Equity (followed by another two rounds, of $11 million total, over the next few years). The company sold its first contract to WagerWorks, an offshore gambling site, in the fall of 2005. Growth proved slow—a few million in revenue during those first years, using a few dozen employees—but very steady.\n\nBy the time Sequoia Capital led the firm's $41.4 million Series D in late 2009, managing partner Doug Leone says he had never seen such positive reviews from customers. ServiceNow's revenue was doubling annually, and the company became cash-flow positive, expanding deals with customers like Deutsche Bank, Intel and McDonald's and reaching 100 employees.\n\nIt was at this point that Luddy put his ego aside and decided to replace himself. He knew product. He needed a CEO who knew growth. Leone took Luddy on a host of interviews. In the Dutchman Frank Slootman, a non-coddling, no-nonsense executive who had taken Data Domain public before selling it to EMC, Leone saw \"a match made in heaven.\"\n\nSlootman focused on building out the sales team and tailoring the product to larger, higher-paying customers like Johnson & Johnson. \"Frank took us from a very large startup,\" Luddy says, \"and he made us into a very large, well-oiled machine, implementing processes and procedures and really scaling out the organization in a way I never could have.\"\nA crossroads came in late 2011, when VMware offered $2.5 billion for the company, according to Leone. Luddy wanted to sell—he thought ServiceNow's product map could thrive within VMware, and the sale would mean financial security—as did much of the board. But Sequoia saw that as \"giving the company away,\" in Leone's words. \"We thought ServiceNow had a great product-market fit, a great leadership team,\" he adds. \"They're also in a winner-take-all market—you cannot name the number two company to Salesforce.\"\n\nLeone saw an easy path to $10 billion and put his money where his mouth was, offering to buy out anyone at the VMware price. Ultimately, no one bit.\n\nAt first it was a tough road. For three or four months, Sequoia was not exactly the best friend of the management team, says Leone. But then slowly, the company saw more and more traction in the marketplace. The company went public in June 2012, but it still wasn't any better off than if it had sold to VMware.\n\nArmed with cash from the offering, as well as the ability to issue new shares, Slootman began buying companies to acquire new underlying technology and—much like Salesforce, Microsoft and just about every major technology player—to invest in artificial intelligence. ServiceNow began growing even faster. It had essentially become a one-stop shop for CIOs, centralizing and automating many common IT help-desk tasks like tracking incidents, recovering passwords, requesting equipment, setting up new user

Neither Wayne Newton nor Celine Dion, Siegfried nor Roy, has anything on Luddy in Sin City this day, at least among the 18,000 customers, vendors and employees in town for Knowledge, ServiceNow's annual developers conference.\n\"When all of these people are happy to see you, honestly you feel like a rock star,\" says the sparkly-eyed Luddy, having booked extra time between appearances to grip-and-grin with the adoring hordes. \"It's kind of an undeserved feeling, because they were the inspiration. You folks had all of the ideas. I just wrote them down and thought about them.\"\n\nForgive Luddy such indulgences. Fourteen years ago, he was pretty much broke, having seen a $35 million personal fortune vanish overnight in the midst of accounting fraud at his previous company. Thirteen years ago he was a one-man shop, tinkering with ServiceNow's core product from his home. Even after the vindication of an IPO six years ago, the company was worth a modest $2 billion.\n\nThese days ServiceNow, based in Santa Clara, California, maintains a $30 billion market cap—and the No. 1 ranking on the 2018 Forbes Most Innovative Companies list. The 6,000-person-plus company has more than 4,000 customers, including 850 on the Forbes Global 2000 list of the world's biggest public firms. Last year it had revenues of $1.93 billion, and growth is expected to be more than 30% this year. More than 500 companies spend at least $1 million annually on ServiceNow's products.\n\nWhat are they getting? A simple, flexible workflow that allows employees to easily manage their requests from IT. Much as Salesforce enables a company to manage its external clients by keeping a record of all contacts and interactions (and, increasingly, by telling sales reps what their next step should be), ServiceNow promises an internal system to meet the needs of employees, beating out legacy IT service-management software players like BMC Software, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Cherwell Software and CA Technologies to claim half of that market.\n\nThe special sauce—the thing that gives ServiceNow the fat \"innovation premium\" that drives our ranking—comes from two product traits with the potential to scale: simplicity and customizability. ServiceNow's IT tools don't require the IT department to set them up. Once running, they offer a single collection center for requests, data points and checklists, all of which can in turn be analyzed by algorithms to predict needs, flag concerns and measure efficiency. Even in a business where renewal rates are commonly at least 90%, ServiceNow stands out at 98%. \"They have cemented themselves as the number one IT partner for the biggest companies in the world, and they don't get fired,\" says Alex Zukin, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. All those traits point to a future beyond just IT services.\n\nBut Luddy's triumph also comes from innovation in management: specifically, the rare founder trait of knowing when it's time to step aside and let someone else run your baby. Luddy transitioned from CEO to chief product officer in 2011. \"Fred has been a wonderful counselor, coach, friend, as well as someone who challenges us to constantly improve our user experience, constantly make sure our products are easier and easier to use,\" says the current CEO, John Donahoe, who previously served as CEO of eBay.\n\nEgo restraint pays, at least on our list, as ServiceNow came out ahead of Facebook, Tesla and a slew of other founder-centric tech giants launched in the same time period. In lieu of brashness, Luddy pushes wisdom, having started ServiceNow at the ripe old age (by tech standards) of 50. Okay, 49 years and 346 days, beating his big birthday by two weeks. \"I couldn't wait,\" he says, \"because there was something psychologically that said I couldn't start a company at 50.\" If anything, Luddy's saga proves that sentiment wrong, with an innovation ingredient that's often undervalued in Silicon Valley: experience.\n\nThe roots of ServiceNow's spectacular rise can be found in the ashes of an IT software-management company called Peregrine Systems, which at one point was valued at more than $4 billion. Over 13 years, Luddy, the CTO, provided the company's engine, but it turned out that the growth came from more specious sources. Peregrine employed several fraudulent methods to inflate its revenue numbers and stock price over a two-year period. In 2002, this former high-flier suddenly filed for bankruptcy, and several top executives, including the CEO, went to prison. Luddy wasn't charged with any wrongdoing in the criminal case, and his $35 million stake vanished overnight.\n\n\"I really hated my job,\" Luddy says, with the perspective that time and a billion dollars will give you. \"Losing that money was absolutely the best thing that could have happened.\" Rather than mope, Luddy decided to take what he hated—IT departments too difficult for the common worker to deal with—and try to make back that lost money and then some.

The purpose of GlideAjax is to allow for the scripts on the client-side to send and receive information to and from the server. An example of its uses is when we need to make a GlideRecord call in a client script.\n\n*Note: GlideAjax requires prior knowledge of JavaScript*\n\nOverview and Brief Explanation #\nIt has both client side and server side components. The GlideAjax class enables a client script to call server side code in a script includes.\nThe GlideAjax API itself is a client side API, but is used to call server side in a script-includes\nIt has both client side and server side components and is similar to jQuery's AJAX method.\nAJAX stands for \"Asynchronous Javascript And XML\"\nUsed to make client side requests to the server-side without requiring a \"page reload\", ServiceNow utilizes a browser API called XMLHttpRequest to make AJAX calls (GlideAjax calls this API to make requests, but uses a layer of abstraction)\nStages of GlideAjax #\nClient side code calls the GlideAjax API, which is making an XMLHttpRequest behind the scenes to the server\nServer side processes the request and returns a response\nThe client side processes the response (we have to tell the browser what to do with the information in the response from the server)\nScripting Locations #\nThere are two scripting locations to GlideAjax: Server side and client side.\n\nWhile GlideAjax API is a client side API, we are still accessing server side code. Client script which contains GlideAjax API and methods. often times stored in client scripts or UI pages.\n\nServer side code is stored in a script include\n\nGlideAjax Process #\nHere is an example of the GlideAjax process:\n\nWhen we're on a task record like an incident, after the form loads, we want to make an AJAX request to the server side, which will update the location of the current user, leveraging the browser's geolocation API.\nOnce the page loads, the browser pulls in the current user's location, makes a request in the background via GlideAjax, to the server side to save that to the record\n\nClient makes a request for a page that contains a client script with GlideAjax.\nServer processes the request from the client, it sends client task form along with client script.\nAfter the onLoad event occurs, the client side script is executed which calls the GlideAjax API.\nGlideAjax accesses browser's XMLHttpRequest API and generates a request.\nBrowser's XMLHttpRequest API sends data back to ServiceNow in the background.\nA request from the client invokes a Script include, where request data is used to call certain methods with arguments. The data is packaged up in the form of a response.\nBrowser receives response from the server side\nClient Script callback processes returned data and updates location field on

Services offerings may include both products and services.\n\nRequest Item Writing Tips #\nAvoid capitalizing every word in a header, question or phrase. The first letter of the first word of variables in a catalog item should be capitalized (i.e. Phone number). Capitalize professional titles, organizations, and other proper nouns, but in general, avoid the use of caps.\nAvoid the use of acronyms. If an acronym is required, the full name should be written out the first time it is used with its corresponding acronym in parenthesis (i.e. Associated Press (AP)).\nUse clear and concise language. For variable questions, typically verbs are not necessary. (i.e. “Requestor’s job title” rather than “Enter the requestor’s job title.”)\nGeneral Formatting #\nA cascading style sheet (CSS) has been created that adheres to University guidelines. This style sheet applies standard formatting to all aspects of the Service Hub, including the public-facing Knowledge Base.\n\nFont Tags - Do not change or insert Font Tags into any allowable HTML field. This erroneous code diminishes the set standards. Bold or italic may be used for impact on the content it references.\nPhone numbers - Use the traditional formatting convention for phone numbers:\nArea code followed by 7 digits; (NPA) NXX-XXXX where NPA is the area code and NXX-XXXX is the subscriber number\nArea code wrapped in parentheses \"( )\"\nThe subscriber number is separated by a hyphen (\"-\")\nDates - Use International Organization for Standardization (ISO) format:\nFour-digit year first, followed by month, then day: YYYY-MM-DD\nWith each separated by a hyphen (\"-\")\nNumbers less than 10 preceded by a leading zero\nYears expressed as \"0\" prior to year 1 and as \"-1\" for the year prior to year 0 (and so forth)\nForm Design Guidelines #\nStandard content blocks. All request forms should maintain the three content block standard.\nCustomer Information – This section captures the customer's details including contact method, department, and any relevant authorization information. This serves as validation of who is entering information into the form. There are two variable sets available for this block, one with Request on behalf of, and one without. This section includes the following standard fields.\nPrimary Contact - UI policy to auto-populate with CAS authentication\nEmail – auto-populates\nTelephone – auto-populates\nRequest on behalf of – optional field\nRequest Information – This is the body of the form. The variables in this block must be held in containers. The number of questions in this block is determined by the requirements of the request.\nAdditional Information – This content block is for supplemental information such as attachments or additional information that are not captured in the body of the form. There are two variable sets available, Include Billing and Exclude Billing. Do not use the Additional Information variable set if the RITM workflow is completely automated. The customer may assume that information entered will be reviewed.\nVariable sets. Variable sets are standard sets of fields that can be used across multiple forms. Using variable sets keep forms standardized and make for a consistent user experience. They should be used whenever possible.\nAgreement checkbox. Include this checkbox on impactful items that deal with matters such as account cancellation or finances. A script has been developed and is available which inactivates the \"Submit\" button unless the agreement is checked/acknowledged.\nColumns. Column usage will be up to the form designer's discretion, but here are some general guidelines:\nFields that trigger/reveal other fields should generally be two columns, revealing the other field either below or to the right of the first field.\nMost multi line text fields should be one column spanning the width of the page.\nSingle line text fields will generally be one column, spanning half the page.\nDrop downs. If a drop down field is mandatory, it should default to \"None\" so the requester must choose one of the options before submission is allowed. If a drop down field is not mandatory, a \"None\" option is not needed.\nMulti line vs Single line Question dependent, but multi lines should only be used for lengthy questions such as asking for additional detail.\nGuide to Usability #\nTooltips (rollover or hover functionality) are the primary method used for \"help text.\" The majority of variables in a form will require a tooltip; the exception to this standard is when the variable name is its definition.\nMore information should be used sparingly in support of more complicated content within the variable. This is a secondary solution to the tooltip. More information appears in grey under the input field. Do not include information directed to an individual or group, requirements, or terms and conditions.\nCommon variables used in form design:\nSelect Box - drop down menu item to be used in cases of a single item needing to be selected from a list of items.\nYes / No - a select box variable type used for questions with a Yes or No answer.\nCheck Boxes - individual options that are true or false.

Login to any out-of-the-box Tokyo instance\n2. Go to Incident Form (incident.do) and Try to add a field of type HTML on the form using (Configure Form Layout).\n3. Once the field is added try to minimise the Text Area of HTML field\n\nObserve the Text Area becomes completely shrunk.\nTry the same steps (1 to 3) in Rome & SanDiego Instance, You will observe text area cannot be shrunk beyond a limit.\n\nExpected behavior:\nText area should not be shrunk beyond a limit just like in Rome & SanDiego version\n\nActual behavior:\nThe text area of TinyMCE is getting

However, if the value of pValue is NULL, it would generate a query like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT task0.`sys_id` FROM task task0  WHERE task0.`correlation_id` IS NULL\n```\n... and this might in fact return hundreds, thousands, or more records, and most likely the logic of the code will be broken as these do not match any correlation_id value. A good practice is to always check your input variables before processing. For example:\n\n```js\nif (pValue) {\n  var gr = new GlideRecord('task');\n  gr.addQuery('correlation_id', pValue);\n  gr.query();\t\n}\n```\nAlternatively, you could use:\n\n```js\nif

Also, close all Legacy Chat records before moving to Connect.\nCan links in Connect Support conversations point to the Service Portal?\n\nWe suggest setting up a Service Portal redirect to have record links created or linked in Connect direct end-users to the Portal. This will not work for knowledge articles and we do not currently have any built-in functionality for this but plan to implement a better integration with \nHow to Set Up Servicer Portal Redirect\nCan the email notifications for each comment to a conversation after incident creation from Connect be limited?\n\nThis behavior was brought to development via PRB681459 and marked as an Enhancement for the future but is still a work in progress. Development did provide a potential workaround for the issue via this Known Error KB0657223 - Connect Support chat sessions that continue after incident creation result in emails sent for each subsequent connect message.\nCan the Service Desk: Call plugin be integrated with Connect Support?\n\nIn the current version of the platform, Jakarta, the primary table for Service Desk: Call new_call does not extend the task table and therefore should not be integrated with Connect Support. With a PRB for this, there is potential to integrate the two plugins better in the future.\nCan the system messages from Connect, such as when a user joins or leaves, be saved in the incident activity created from a conversation?\n\nYes, In HP6 and above, set the sys_property glide.connect.support.reflect_system_messages to true and it will have the activity of the associated record store the system messages from the Connect conversation.\nCan we hide the average wait time for a queue?\n\nWe do not have a way to completely remove the wait time message, but if you remove the value from the queue record it will just display \"Wait time:\".\nYou can also edit the business rule \"SNC - Chat Queue Average Wait Time\" so it does not update when records from that queue are accepted.\nHow are the fields customized on Record Cards shown in the Connect window ($c.do)? (linked records/knowledge and records created from Support)\n\nSee KB0647754 - Configure the fields shown on record cards in Connect\nHow Do I disable the Connect Plugin?\n\nRead our documentation on how to Disable Connect Chat or for more detailed info read KB0656241 - How to deactivate the Connect plugin \nHow does the platform determine the support conversation states?\n\nConnect Support chat states \nHow is the Average Wait Time calculated for a Chat Queue?\n\nThere is a business rule named SNC - Chat Queue Average Wait Time on the chat_queue_entry table. It averages the wait time of the last 20 'Work in Progress' chats ordered by opened_at. \nHere is a link to the Business Rule: /nav_to.do?uri=sys_script.do?sys_id=e2479357c0a8015274607cd0fe2d9ffd\nHow to limit which users can access Connect?\n\nThis can be done by role using the connect.roles sys_property. View the Docs on Connect Properties.\nHow to receive Audio notifications when someone joins the Queue?\n\nIn Helsinki Patch 7, Istanbul Patch 2, and newer, a sys_property has been added: glide.connect.support.enter_queue_audio_alert, which can be set to true in order to hear audio alerts when a new chat enters the queue.\nHow was Connect enabled on my instance?\n\nHere is KB0647741 - Connect Plugin Activation and How to Disable Connect which explains how this may have been enabled.\nIs there any way to only show the Agent / Users first name in Connect Support?\n\nThe name used in Connect comes from the Live Profile record of the user so if you edit the live profile record then Connect will only show the first name. This will affect all Connect and Live Feed not just support conversations.

It is our hope that documenting some of the common scripting issues we see related to performance will be useful to those developers using the platform.\n\nInstructions\n1) Using the SetLimit Function\nThere are many times when querying tables that ServiceNow developers may want to grab on a limited number of records or check if records fitting some criteria exist. On a database from SQL we would be running something like the following.\n\n```sql\nSELECT * from MyAwesomeTable WHERE awesome = 1 LIMIT 5\n```\n\nThe LIMIT clause tells the database to only pick 5 records from the result set. We can achieve the same functionality from GLIDE. To do this, you want to use the \"SetLimit\" function on your GlideRecord. Developers should be utilizing this feature whenever they query large tables and are looking for one result or any query they are unsure of the result size. You should also use this to limit results on any page listing the results to achieve pagination. Even scripts benefit from this, using the setLimit, you can paginate results if your script may be running a query on a large data set like something in the CMDB. Below are some common usages and pitfalls.\n\n```js\n//Let's just print all of the active incidents.\nvar active_incidents = new GlideRecord('incident');\nactive_incidents.addActiveQuery();\nactive_incidents.query();\nwhile(active_incidents.next()){\n  gs.print(active_incidents.number);\n}\n\n*** Script: INC0017107\n*** Script: INC0016450\n*** goes on and on\n```\n\nSet Limit Code\n\n```js\n//You know what? That was too many, let's print one active incident\nvar active_incidents = new GlideRecord('incident');\nactive_incidents.addActiveQuery();\nactive_incidents.setLimit(1);\nactive_incidents.query();\nwhile(active_incidents.next()){\n  gs.print(active_incidents.number);\n}\n\n*** Script: INC0017107\n\n**DONE**\n```\n\nChecking for one record\nThis is a common situation we see in support. Many developers will come up with something like the following to check if there is a record that exists before updating. We can write a little example code and then we will review some common issues that appear.\n\n```js\n//The idea behind the following is that all VM's have a special_identifier and that identifier will only have one group associated to it. \n//So we can query an already existing vm with that identifier and use it's group for our new VM.\nfunction addNewVM(new_vm){\n   var virtual_machines = new GlideRecord('cmdb_ci_vm');\n   virtual_machines.addQuery('status', 'Operational');\n   virtual_machines.addQuery('u_special_identifier', new_vm.u_special_identifier);\n   virtual_machines.query();\n   if(virtual_machines.next())\n     new_vm.u_special_group = virtual_machines.u_special_group\n   new_vm.u_special_group.update();\n}\n```\n\nThere are actually several problems we may not have anticipated about the above. What if the new_vm special identifier is NULL? The ServiceNow platform will still run that query and we will get the following.\n\n```sql\nSELECT * from cmdb_ci_vm WHERE status = 'Operational' and u_special_identifier IS NULL\n```\n\nIf there are VM's without a u_special_identifer, then we may actually get a large query that, while we only look at 1 record, the platform still goes and gets the entire list. Another possible issue is growth over time. In the beginning we only have a few VM's in the groups. This query runs very quickly as our selection count is low. Over time, we expand those groups and now the groups have thousands of members. The above will be running a query for thousands of records to only look at 1 record. That leads to lots of wasted processing. We should modify the code above to prevent these issues.\n\n```js\nfunction addNewVMToGroup(new_vm){\n  //If our new vm does not have an identifier, then don't even try this\n  if(new_vm.u_special_identifier == null)\n    return;\n\n  var virtual_machines = new GlideRecord('cmdb_ci_vm');\n\n  virtual_machines.addQuery('status', 'Operational');\n  virtual_machines.addQuery('u_special_identifier', new_vm.u_special_identifier);\n\n  //We only need 1 record so let's just get 1.\n  virtual_machines.setLimit(1);\n  virtual_machines.query();\n\n  if(virtual_machines.next()){\n    new_vm.u_special_group = virtual_machines.u_special_group\n    new_vm.update();\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow with the above we will get only one record even if both the

It is our hope that documenting some of the common scripting issues we see related to performance will be useful to those developers using the platform.\n\nPaginating Script Results\nIf we have a script or even a rest service that will need to iterate over a very large result set, we can buffer those results using the setLimit function so as not to overwhelm either the system or an endpoint.\n\n```js\n//This function will migrate vm's from one group to the other\nfunction addNewVMToGroup(old_group, new_group){\n    //set our limit count\n     var LIMIT = 10000;\n\n    //Get a count of all the records we will be migrating\n    var count = new GlideAggregate('cmdb_ci_vm');\n    count.addAggregate('COUNT');\n    count.addQuery('status', 'Operational');\n    count.addQuery('u_special_group', old_group);\n\n    count.query();\n    var q_count = 0;\n    if (count.next())\n     q_count = count.getAggregate('COUNT');\n\n    while(count > 0){\n      var virtual_machines = new GlideRecord('cmdb_ci_vm');\n      virtual_machines.addQuery('status', 'Operational');\n      virtual_machines.addQuery('u_special_group', old_group);\n\n      //We could be moving a large group lets limit the result set.\n      virtual_machines.setLimit(LIMIT);\n\n      virtual_machines.query();\n\n      while(virtual_machines.next()){\n        virtual_machines.u_special_group = new_group;\n        virtual_machines.update();\n      }\n    count--;\n  }\n}\n```\nGetting the latest or oldest record\nIt is common practice to look at records ordered by some date value. For our example, we will be looking at the simple idea that we want the oldest or newest record however this idea applies to ordering by almost any date field if you want the beginning or end. In the example below, if we had not included the setLimit, we would have ended up bringing back the entire table! Using the setLimit has the added benefit that if the field is indexed, there are MariaDB optimizations to return your query even faster.\n\n```js\nfunction getOldestVm(){\n  var virtual_machines = new

It is our hope that documenting some of the common scripting issues we see related to performance will be useful to those developers using the platform.\n\n3) Avoid typographical errors in your code\nJavascript is unforgiving and if you specify the wrong field name, it will not give you any errors. The ServiceNow platform will throw an error, but only in the localhost logs.\nEven then, the code will continue to run. For example, see the piece of code below.\n\n```js\nvar pValue;\nvar gr = new GlideRecord('task');\ngr.addQuery('correlation_id_oops', pValue);\ngr.query();\n```\n\nYou will get a query like this:\n\nOh no! We are pulling the entire task table!!!\nSELECT task0.`sys_id` FROM task task0\nAnd the following will be logged:\n\nQueryEventLogger: Invalid query detected, please check logs for details [Unknown

As a wrapper over GlideRecord, it can catch mistakes earlier in the development process and simplify many queries. \n\nServer-side API for querying data\n\nWritten in 100% JavaScript (global Script Include)\nUses GlideRecordbehind the scenes\nAvailable starting with the Paris release\nWhy?\n\nGlideQueryis guided by three principles.\n                     \n\nHow to enable?\n\nGlideQueryrequires the GlideQuery(com.sn_glidequery) plugin be installed.\n\nNavigate to System Definitions -> Plugins.\nSearch for GlideQuery.\nSelect the Installbutton\nThe Activate Plugin window may show additional plugins that will be activated as well.\nSelect the Activate button to install the plugin.\n                              \n\nAnother way to install a plugin is through a script. To install the plugin for GlideQueryusing this method, follow these directions:\nNavigate to System Definitions -> Fix Scripts.\nCreate the script below, save, run the script, and select proceed.\nA message with the time it took to run the script appears.\nValidate the script installed by using System Definitions -> Plugins.\n                        \n\nAdvantages\n\nGlideQuery: Fail Fast -Improve the Feedback Loop\n\nGlideRecord has been used for many years. GlideQueryis new and this may be the first time you are seeing this type of code.\nOne thing to note is the reduction of code. In these examples, 4 lines became 3, 6 became 4, and 7 became 5. Can you write code that is less formatted to make less lines? Sure, but less lines of nicely formatted code can save you time in development and be easier to maintain.\n                               \n\nBusiness Rule update / Insert Checks\n\nIn this example, the GlideRecordtries to update a record on a table with a business rule that rejects start_datebeing after end_date.\nThe code continues to execute, but the record has not been updated.\n                        \n\nGlideQuery: Be JavaScript -Isolated from Java\n\nKeeping it simple, stringly-typed (or stringly-types) usually occurs when a programmerdecides to use strings for every type of data type, despite there being better and more efficient data types available. This often happenswhen the developer doesn't know the correct programming practices necessary for what they are trying to accomplish and can lead to unpredictable results during program execution.\n                              \n\nBe JavaScript -Stack Traces\n\nOne thing that has been a welcome change is the NiceError. Let’s take a lookat why this is a big change. A GlideRecord error provides a Java Stack Trace that can be confusing.\nGlideRecord Java Stack Trace\n\nQueryEventLogger: Invalid query detected, please check logs for details [Unknown field las_namein table sys_user]Invalid query detected, stack trace below [Unknown field las_namein table sys_user] com.glide.db.QueryEventLogger.logInvalidQuery(QueryEventLogger.java:56) com.glide.db.QueryEventLogger.logInvalidQuery(QueryEventLogger.java:47) com.glide.script.GlideRecord.isInvalidTableField(GlideRecord.java:2380) com.glide.script.GlideRecord.jsFunction_addQuery(GlideRecord.java:2031) sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor44.invoke(Unknown Source) sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43) java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498) org.mozilla.javascript.MemberBox.invoke(MemberBox.java:138) org.mozilla.javascript.FunctionObject.doInvoke(FunctionObject.java:670) org.mozilla.javascript.FunctionObject.call(FunctionObject.java:614)\n\nGlideQueryNiceErrorin comparison:\n\nNiceError: [2020-08-04T05:19:17.028Z]: Unknown field 'las_name' in table 'sys_user’.

Requires a where call, specifying all existing primary keys (usually sys_id).\n\n           Returns an Optional of the newly-updated record. Passes in a reason string (just like GlideRecord'supdate).\n\nglideQuery.deleteMultiple() ⇒nothing\n           Deletes all records in the table specified by preceding whereclauses.\n\n                    \n\nGlideQuery: Optional Class Example\n\n                \n\nGlideQuery: Performance Considerations\n\nPerformance Considerations\n\nYou may be asking yourself, if GlideQuery is the latest technique for working with data, then why does it take longer to query data? GlideQueryis an API for GlideRecord.\nGlideRecordrecord values need to be converted into JavaScript values. This can account for 4% to 6% overhead in a query. Also, Insert and Update will have some overhead due to the checking that occurs. Even with the drop in performance, GlideQuerycan avoids poorly written GlideRecord since its syntax is geared to use the most efficient code available.\nFuture Work\n\nGlideQuerybrings many new features, but there is still work that needs to be done.

One 'gr' can be replaced by the other 'gr' for something completely unrelated, and your script will continue running subsequent lines thinking it is the one it defined.\n\nYour script could end up returning no query result, or updating a different record, from even a different table, than the one you have just queried for in your script. That can clearly have serious implications.\n\nA real world example:\n\nIn a customer's incident, a simple gr.get(); query of the incident table from a script in a workflow returned no records returned because the Requested Item table was actually what was unknowingly being queried.\nThat was due to a requested item query business rule running, for a linked related record being run in the same transaction, that happened to also use 'gr' for the sc_req_item table.\nThe custom script in the workflow assumed a record was returned, but did not actually check. It used the gr.assigned_to value, which was null, and did not check it had a real value.\nThe 'null' result was then used for another query on the user table for a Notification, resulting in every employee in the company receiving the email.\nOuch!\nIn this kind of situation debugging to figure out what other code is breaking your code is also almost impossible, as you have to take everything running as part of the complete transaction into account. Adding lots of gs.info() messages into the code to double check all the values.\n\nResolution\nGeneral good javascript coding practice would avoid most of these issues.\n\nYou could wrap your scripts in a function to avoid your script clobbering another gr, which is why new business rules, calculated fields, etc. mostly now have a default script added to wrap the code to protect the variables within the function, but most scripts and including older business rules don't require this. Wrapping your code in a function is good coding practice, so always do this.\n\nWhen using more than one GlideRecord in your script, you may also accidentally re-use the gr name. The best practice is to use your own unique variable names, relevant to the table you are using, and never use 'gr'. e.g. \n\nfunction updateOpenIncidents() {\n    var openIncidentGr = new GlideRecord('incident');\n    ....\n}\nupdateOpenIncidents(); // runs the above function\nSo, just don't do it, and you will reduce the chances of this happening.\n\nAdditional Information\nThis doesn't just apply to \"gr\". Using \"i\" as a for loop counter everywhere is also bound to cause trouble sooner or later. Symptoms would be for loops that end early or go infinite.\n\nThe platform has reserved names, which should also never be used for your own variables: answer, current, previous etc.\n\nProblem tickets directly related to this cause:\n\nPRB1320166 MID Server Business rule 'Probe - All MIDs' isn't protecting its global scope javascript variables from being clobbered (MID Servers wrongly reported as DOWN)\nPRB612498 Use of \"answer\" variable (or other same variable name) in script & calculated dictionary fields, will cause \"answer\" variable in script overwritten by calculated field

Take steps to make your code manageable, efficient, and scalable from the early stages. This helps to ensure good performance, reduces the chances of problems, and simplifies the debugging process.\n\nCovered in this guide:\n\nMake Code Easy to Read\nCreate Small, Modular Components\nVariables\nInteracting with the Database\nUse Self-Executing Functions\nAvoid Coding Pitfalls\nMake Code Easy to Read\nWhen writing code, remember that others may work with it in the future. Whenever possible, ensure your code is easy to read and understand. Follow any formatting standards used by your organization.\n\nCovered in this section:\n\nComment Your Code\nUse White Space\nWrite Simple Statements\n\nComment Your Code\nWhat may seem obvious today may not be clear in the future, especially on a complicated section of code. Comments should be well-written and clear, just like the code they are annotating.\n\nSingle line comments start with a double forward slash (//) and can be placed anywhere on the line. Everything after the // and up to the new line is considered a comment. \n\nBlock comments start with a forward slash and one asterisk (/*) and end with the reversed combination (*/). Everything between the markers is considered a comment. Adding extra asterisks, like those shown in this example, can make it easier to locate blocks of comments.\n\nClearly describe the purpose of functions and all inputs and outputs. \n\nKeep comments as accurate as possible. Erroneous comments can make programs even harder to read and understand. Also be sure to keep comments up to date as the scripts are updated. The comment in this code section does not clearly describe its function.\n\nWrite meaningful comments. Focus on what is not immediately visible\n\nUse White Space\nUse empty lines and spaces to make code more readable. The easier it is to read code, the easier it is to identify and correct issues. Empty lines help visually group blocks of code together so the reader can see the logical organization. Spaces on each line help make the items on an individual line easier to read.\n\nThe format code button in the ServiceNow syntax editor toolbar is a useful tool for adjusting indentation without altering other spacing.\n\nThe lack of indentation and spacing in the previous example makes it difficult to determine the flow of logic. By adding a few spaces, the code becomes more readable\n\nWrite Simple Statements\nRemember that less experienced developers may work with your code in the future. Make it as easy to maintain as possible. In general, it is the compiler's job to make code fast, so minimize the use of fancy tricks.\n\nFor example, experienced programmers may not have an issue with the JavaScript ternary operator:\n\n```js\nvar result = (x == y) ? a : b;\n```\n\nLess experienced developers may find it challenging to understand. Instead, the statement could be written more clearly as:\n\n```js\nvar result;  \n\nif (x == y) {  \n    result = a;  \n}  \nelse {  \n    result = b;   \n}\n```\n\nCreate Small, Modular Components\nBreak your code into modular components or specialized functions. Script Include functions are excellent examples of this technique. Script Includes are essentially libraries of functionality that can be implemented in other server-side scripts, such as Business Rules, UI actions, and Script Actions. Some of the benefits of specialized functions include:\n\nThey are easy to create because they are small and simple with limited functionality.\nThey are generally simpler and shorter, so it is easy to understand the logic, inputs, and outputs. This makes it easier for the next person who works with the code to make modifications.\nThey are easier to test. As a related note, when you test the code, be sure to test both valid and invalid inputs to ensure the script is as robust as possible.\nAs you create small specialized functions, keep in mind how the small bits fit together in a larger construct. For example, you may find that doing a query of the same data inside ten separate functions is not database-friendly, and that a different approach is necessary.\n\nConstruct Reusable Functions\nIf you see the same or similar logic repeated in a process, consider creating a specialized function.

Take steps to make your code manageable, efficient, and scalable from the early stages. This helps to ensure good performance, reduces the chances of problems, and simplifies the debugging process.\n\nVariables\nCovered in this section:\n\nUse Descriptive Variable and Function Names\nUse Variables to Store Function Results\nVerify Values Exist Before Using Them\nReturn Values\nAvoid Dynamic JEXL Expressions in an Evaluate\nAvoid the eval Function\nUse Descriptive Variable and Function Names\nMeaningful names for functions and variables better indicate to readers the purpose of code.\n\nIt is difficult to determine the purpose of function del(r, d, s)\n\nThough it is helpful to be descriptive, there are cases where shorter variable names are acceptable. In some programming languages, it is common practice to use the variable i for counting in a looping statement (such as for loops). \n\nUse Variables to Store Function Results\nAvoid situations where the same function is repeatedly called with the same result. This is common when you call functions with no parameters. Depending on the function, repeated calls may negatively affect performance.\n\nWhen possible, use a descriptive variable to store a value and refer to the variable instead of calling the same function repeatedly. Using variables can also make the code easier to understand.\n\nVerify Values Exist Before Using Them\nTo avoid unpredictable results and warning messages, verify that variables and fields have a value before using them. \n\nAny additional statements which use the variable table may throw warning messages in the system log if the value is undefined. This can happen if the cmdb_ci field is empty or if the installed_on field in the CI is empty.\n\nReturn Values\nGet in the practice of returning some type of value when you create new functions. The value returned can tell the calling code useful information about how the function executed. Examples of return values include:\n\nThe number of records read from a table (return 0 to indicate an error).\nThe success status of a particular operation (return true to indicate success).\nA JavaScript object (return NULL to indicate a failure).\n\nAvoid Dynamic JEXL Expressions in an Evaluate\nWhen writing Jelly code, avoid using dynamic JEXL expressions inside the Jelly tag (or <g2:evaluate> for phase two). While the code appears to work, it affects a memory resource (called PermGen) in the Java Virtual Machine, which can lead to performance issues and even system outages over time. The exception to using JEXL expressions inside <g:evaluate> tags is with static values, including: ${AMP}, ${AND}, ${GT}, ${LT}, and ${SP} (and their phase two counterparts: $[AMP], $[AND], and so on).\n\nA better way to use Jelly variables inside <g:evaluate> tags is to include the attribute jelly=\"true\", then reference a copy of the variable with the jelly. prefix.\n\nAvoid the eval Function\nThe eval() function evaluates or executes an argument. Improper use of eval() opens up your code for injection attacks and debugging can be more challenging, as no line numbers are displayed with an error, for

Take steps to make your code manageable, efficient, and scalable from the early stages. This helps to ensure good performance, reduces the chances of problems, and simplifies the debugging process.\n\nInteracting with the Database\nCovered in this section:\n\nAvoid Complex GlideRecord Queries\nUse GlideAggregate for Simple Record Counting\nAvoid Complex Queries on Large Data Sets\nLet the Database Do the Work\nAvoid Complex GlideRecord Queries\nRather than creating a series of addQuery() and addOrCondition() calls to obtain a result, use addEncodedQuery() to make the query easier to create and maintain.\n\nConsider a requirement to obtain a list of all active Apple printers and computers in a company's Santa Ana office. Creating the proper combination of addQuery() and addOrCondition() queries to get the proper solution may sound simple. However, if the requirement changes and you are asked to add another office location and a different hardware manufacturer to the list, the task of maintaining the query can become challenging.\n\nFor complex GlideRecord queries, it is easier to create a query string by generating encoded query strings through a filter and using that string with addEncodedQuery. As requirements change, you can create a new query string using the list filter, verify the results with the requirement author, and use the query in the same script.\n\nUse GlideAggregate for Simple Record Counting\nIf you need to count rows, you have two options: the getRowCount() method from GlideRecord, or GlideAggregate. Using GlideRecord to count rows can cause scalability issues as tables grow over time, because it retrieves every record with the query and then counts them. GlideAggregate gets its result from built-in database functionality, which is much quicker and doesn't suffer from the scalability issues that GlideRecord does.\n\nAvoid Complex Queries on Large Data Sets\nLimit the number of times you search large tables. As your instance grows, these searches can affect performance. Assume you have a requirement to search the CMDB for the importance of all upstream services related to a specific server when that server is added to the Incident form. Running a query on the Relationship [cmdb_rel_ci] table is not a problem for a simple CMDB with a few hundred or thousand CIs. However, for a CMDB with three million CIs and hundreds of thousands of relationships, the query could take hours.\n\nOne solution is to create a related list for the CI that lists affected services. The list can be updated by a business rule as relationships for the CI are updated. When a CI is added to an incident, the affected services list can be quickly retrieved from the related list on the CI, rather than launching a long search on the Relationship table.\n\nLet the Database Do the Work\nWhenever possible, leverage the power of the database to retrieve the proper records. For example, if you are checking 1,000,000 incidents to see if at least one record is active, your first solution may look like this:\n```js\nvar inc = new GlideRecord('incident');\n\ninc.addQuery('active', true);\ninc.query();\n\nif (inc.hasNext())\n   // There is at least one active record\n```\nHowever, if there are 250,000 active records, the query() method has to retrieve all those records. That can take time. Instead, use the setLimit() method to instruct the database to return only one record. Returning one record is much faster than returning all the records.\n```js\nvar inc = new GlideRecord('incident');\n\ninc.addQuery('active', true);\ninc.setLimit(1);  // Tell the database to only retrieve a maximum of 1 record\ninc.query();\n\nif (inc.hasNext())\n   // There is at least one active record\n```\n\nUse Self-Executing Functions\nA self-executing function is both declared and invoked within the same script field. Whenever writing a script that only needs to run in a single context, such as a transform map script, use this type of function. For functions that must run in multiple contexts, consider reusable functions instead.\n\nBy enclosing your script in a self-executing function you can ensure that the script does not impact other areas of the product, such as by overwriting global variables\n\nYou can declare functions within the self-executing function. These inner functions are accessible only from within the self-executing

Take steps to make your code manageable, efficient, and scalable from the early stages. This helps to ensure good performance, reduces the chances of problems, and simplifies the debugging process.\n\nAvoid Coding Pitfalls\nCovered in this section:\n\nExperiment in a Sandbox\nCode in Stages\nDo Not Use Hard-Coded Values\nAvoid Dot-Walking to the sys_id of a Reference Field\nUse getDisplayValue() Effectively\nExperiment in a Sandbox\nTrying out new coding ideas or concepts in a development instance can lead to messy results later on. If you make changes, then alter your approach while using an update set, you may find unwanted changes getting in the update set and being promoted to other instances. If you do not use an update set for your proof of concept, your development instance may behave differently than your other instances, making it difficult to verify defects and fixes.\n\nIf you do not have a sandbox environment available, use a ServiceNow demo instance. When you understand how to implement the new concept in a sandbox, build the solution in development.\n\nCode in Stages\nDo not attempt to write hundreds of lines of code in one sitting. This is especially true if you are learning a new technology. Write a few lines of code at a time and test as you go to ensure it works as expected.\n\nAlthough this process may seem slow and tedious at first, it is ultimately more effective. If you try to write too much code at one time, it becomes difficult to locate the source of a problem. Instead of tracking back through lines and lines of code to find the defect, save time and effort by incrementally writing functional code.\n\nDo Not Use Hard-Coded Values\nAvoid using hard-coded values in scripts, as they can lead to unpredictable results and can be difficult to track down later. Hard coding sys_ids is not recommended, as they may not be the same between instances. Instead, try looking up a value by reference or by creating a property and retrieving the value with gs.getProperty().\n\nHard-coding group, user, or other names often leads to problems when an organizational change occurs. \n\nAlso consider the following example in which a workflow needs an approval from the IT director of Acme Corp. Sara, the former IT director, has been replaced by Dale. See why the initial approach of hard-coding Sara's user information is not preferable.\n\nInitial Approach:\n\nCreate a user approval activity for Sara.\nWhen Dale becomes the new IT director, update the workflow.\nBetter Approach:\n\nThis method eliminates the need to add hard-coded data in the workflow.\n\nCreate a group, IT Director, and make Sara a member.\nUse the Group Approval Activity.\nWhen Dale becomes the new IT director, simply update the group membership instead of the workflow.\nAvoid Dot-Walking to the sys_id of a Reference Field\nIt is not necessary to include the sys_id of a reference field when dot-walking, as in the following example:\n`var id = current.caller_id.sys_id; // Wrong`\n\nThe value of a reference field is a sys_id. When you dot-walk to the sys_id, the system does an additional database query to retrieve the caller_id record, then retrieves the sys_id. This can lead to performance issues. Instead, use the statement.\n\n`var id = current.getValue('caller_id'); // Right`\nUse getDisplayValue() Effectively\nWhen scripting, become familiar with the tables and fields you are using. Instead of using name, number, or other explicit field name used for the display value, use the method getDisplayValue(). Consider the following example:\n\n```js\nvar parent = current.parent.number;\nvar myCI = current.cmdb_ci.name;\n```\n\nYou would be required to update this code if the display value requirement changes on either of these two tables. For example, the business now wants to display the CI's serial number field instead of name. When someone changes the dictionary attribute on the Configuration Item [cmdb_ci] table, from name to serial_number, this code no longer reflects the current requirements. Instead, consider using the following code:\n\n```js\nvar parent = current.parent.getDisplayValue();\nvar myCI = current.cmdb_ci.getDisplayValue();\n```\nTo determine which field on a table is used as

The heart of the migration process is a document that identifies necessary steps to migrate update sets, as well as data not captured by update sets. In some organizations, developers pass the responsibility of the update set migration process to different people or groups. It is also fairly common for more than one developer to maintain changes in multiple update sets, which increases the challenge of tracking details and getting the changes together in each instance. So a document detailing the migration procedure helps the team ensure that all changes operate as expected.\n\nA good migration procedure should address the topics described here, as well as other topics appropriate to the situation.\n\nCovered in this guide:\n\nUpdate Set Application Order\nAdditional Data Migration\nUpdate Set Application Order\nIn the migration procedure, create an ordered list which details how grouped update sets should be applied. Many organizations group system changes in routine (weekly or monthly) updates rather than promoting each change immediately. As several update sets are completed, the order in which they are applied may become important to ensure dependencies are met. For example, if Update Set A creates a new table and Update Set B changes the list layout of that table, committing Update Set B first results in an error. It cannot apply the new list layout to the table because the table has not yet been created.\n\n| Order | Update Set Name  | Description                             |\n|-------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| 1     | R1-CHG-S5-CWT    | Change process sprint 5 weekly update   |\n| 2     | R1-CHG-S5-CWT-P1 | Change process sprint 5 patch 1         |\n| 3     | R1-CHG-D03-CWT   | Change defect bundle #3                 |\n| 4     | R1-INC-S5-BAR    | Incident process sprint 5 weekly update |\n\nAdditional Data Migration\nThe migration procedure should include information about any additional data or configuration changes required to accompany the update sets. For example, some applications and processes, such as approval lookups, require data that is not captured in the update set. Be sure the migration procedure:\n\nIndicates where the additional data files are located. For example, state that they are attached to the update set in the development instance or provide a network drive path.\nProvides instructions for using the export and import procedure to transfer the data using XML files.\nYou may find that certain items need to be updated before or after an update set is committed.

The goal is to help others save a lot of time and avoid making the same mistakes.\n\n\nDisclaimer: The recommendations are based on my personal experiences and are not official ServiceNow best practices. I am happy to discuss the mentioned points with you in the comments and learn about your personal best practices.  \n\n \n\n1. Reduce Efforts with Variable Sets\nOften, individual variables are relevant to more than one Catalog Item. Instead of creating these variables individually for each Catalog Item, a better approach would be to create a Variable Set and share it between multiple Catalog Items. The main benefit is that is saves a lot of time and effort during implementation as well as maintenance in the future. Furthermore, client-side logic such as Client Scripts or UI Policies can be bound to those variable sets and must therefore only be implemented once instead of for each Catalog Item individually.\n\n \n\nBad Practice: Re-creating the same variables for different Catalog Items\n\n\n \n\nGood Practice: Create one Variable Set and share it among multiple Catalog Items\n\n2. Client-Side Validation is Not Secure, Use Server Side for Data Validation\nIn all web applications, client-side validation can technically be bypassed in some way or another. The same of course applies to ServiceNow. Therefore, the general rule should be: “Use Client-side validation for UI/UX design features only and use server-side validations on all integral components of security and data handling”. When developing Catalog Items, it therefore crucial to ask yourself: “What would happen if this Client Script/ UI Script or field setting was bypassed by a malicious user?”\n\n \n\nIn the following, I will provide a simple example on how a malicious user could bypass the “read-only” property on the client-side. For this, the attacker can use the “inspect” feature of his Chrome browser and manipulate the corresponding HTML element by removing the read-only property. The user can now edit the field and set a new “malicious” value. It now depends on the ServiceNow backend configuration whether the Catalog Item has been built in a secure way.\n\nBad Practice: The Backend trusts that the client-side has properly validated the user input and calculates the price based on the submitted value\n\nGood Practice: The backend retrieves the discount value by itself via a backend process (Flow) and does not blindly trust the client-side validated data. The discount field on the form is only used to provide a good user experience and is not used for any critical business logic.\n\n3. Simplify Input Validation with RegEx\nInput validation, specifically on text fields, is often done with complex “on change” Client Scripts. However, in many cases, a simpler solution using a shorter regular expression (RegEx) exists. One benefit of regular expressions is that they can be re-used on other catalog variables as well as backend fields. Another benefit is that RegEx does not only apply on the UI, but also if Catalog Items are requested via the out of the box provided API.\n\n \n\nBad Practice: Achieve input format validation with a complex on change Client Script\n\nGood Practice: Achieve input format validation with a simple RegEx\n\n\n4. Combine Variables in a Multi-Row Variable Set\nInstead of creating the same type of variable multiple times on a single Catalog Item, use a Multi-Row Variable Set and save time during implementation and maintenance. Furthermore, Multi-Row Variable Sets work perfectly together with the “for each” Flow functionality. Instead of performing a Flow step for each item individually, you can loop over the variables and repeat the same action multiple times.\n\n \n\nBad Practice: Create the same type of variable multiple times on one Catalog Item\n\nGood Practice: Use a Multi-Row Variable Set and leverage the “for each” functionality in Flow Designer\n\n5. Avoid List Collector Variable Types\nUnfortunately, List Collector variables are currently not supporting the same “Out of the box” functionalities as other variable types. For example, in the Tokyo release, Flow Designer cannot properly process the values of Collector Variables and will crash if the “for each” functionality is used (see following screenshots).\n\n \n\nBad Practice: Using List Collector variable types and processing them with “for each” functionality in Flow Designer\n\nGood Practice: Use a different variable type, e.g. Multi-Row Variable Set to
