## Air Source Heat Pump Buying Guide


## Air source heat pumps are an effective way to heat and cool homes, while also saving on operating

## costs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. With technological advancements greatly improving

## this type of heating and cooling, thousands of cold-climate heat pumps are being installed at high

## rates of customer satisfaction. To increase buying confidence, this guide offers consumers diverse

## information and guidance to understand how heat pumps work, their major benefits, how to select the

## right type of heat pump, and how to find an installer who can accomplish a high-quality installation.

## This guide is divided into two main sections. Part 1 describes what a heat pump is, how it works,

## what types are available, and how to think about choosing one for your home. It also includes general

## information about heating and cooling costs, and dispels some old myths about heat pumps that

## don’t apply to today’s high-efficiency models. Once you’ve decided you want to move forward with a

## heat pump, Part 2 introduces a series of steps to help you organize the process and offers a checklist

## of questions to ask potential installers. There is more specific guidance on what to look for during the

## design and installation process, based on the type of system you’re installing and how it fits into your

## house.

### Part 1: Air Source Heat Pumps The Basics


A heat pump is a super-efficient, economical, and environmentally-friendly way to heat and cool your home for year-round comfort. Heat pumps run on electricity, but their extreme high efficiency makes them affordable to operate. The cost to heat a house with a heat pump is lower than oil, propane or electric baseboard; in some cases, much lower. Cost is roughly on par with gas heat: depending on electric and gas prices in your area, it may be a bit more or less than gas. High-performance heat pumps save on cooling too: their efficiency is typically more than double that of window units, and substantially more efficient than standard central AC systems. If you’re thinking about adding central AC or exploring what to do when your heating system needs replacing, or if you’re renovating an old house or building a new one, a cold climate heat pump may be the best choice. Properly designed and installed, heat pumps are affordable to operate, highly comfortable, and easy on the environment. In many areas, rebates, incentives and/or favorable loan programs¹ can help pay for the installation – free money, and in some cases additional technical support, when you decide to buy a heat pump. ¹www.dsireusa.org has a national listing of available programs by zip code. It helps to click “Apply Filter / Eligible sector / Residential / All Residential” and then “Apply Filter / Technology / HVAC / All HVAC”. Also check with your state energy office, your local electric and/ or gas utility, or your heat pump installer to learn about programs in your area. Pay attention to the rules and timeline, and be sure to submit any required paperwork.

### Air Source and Ground Source Heat Pumps

The two main categories of heat pump are air-source and ground-source. Air source heat pumps (or ASHPs) use an outdoor unit to extract heat from the air. Ground source heat pumps (or GSHPs; sometimes called “geothermal”) use a network of underground pipes to extract heat from the earth in the winter, and to dump excess heat back in the summer. GSHPs are somewhat more efficient than ASHPs, but they are more expensive to install. They also require adequate land for drilling or burying the ground loop. (For more information, see this guide²). GSHPs make sense for some homeowners, but this guide focuses on air-source systems. ²geoexchange.org/wp-content/uploads/GHPs-Tapping-Energy-Beneath-Our-Feet.pdf ³Taken from Concord Municipal Light Plant (CMLP) “Learn More about ASHPs”: https://concordma.gov/Faq.aspx?QID=462

### How Do Heat Pumps Work?

 A heat pump works by harvesting heat energy. Believe it or not, everything that is warmer than outer space has heat energy in it, and heat pumps are able to push that energy into or out of your home. Even when it’s below zero, there’s still heat in the air. A heat pump effectively extracts heat from the cold outdoors, concentrates it, and delivers it inside to keep you comfortable all winter. (See illustration at right). According to the laws of physics, a lot less energy is required to move heat than to create it. A heat pump might look like a typical air conditioner. It is actually an air conditioner that’s designed to operate in either direction, so it can heat or cool a house as needed. Another big difference from a typical AC is that advanced air source heat pumps are “variable capacity,” which means the motors and fans can speed up or slow down to provide just the right amount of heating or cooling without constantly turning on and off. They are also quieter than most air conditioners and furnaces.³ Some people think that heat pumps just don’t work below freezing, but modern technology has improved performance dramatically. Many of today’s cold-climate models produce plenty of heat down to outdoor temperatures of 5, -5, or even -15 degrees Fahrenheit. ASHP Myth #1: Heat pumps don’t work below freezing Some HVAC installers will tell their customers to turn off the heat pump when outside temperatures drop below freezing. Heat pumps of the 1980’s and 90’s often had such low heat output below 300F that installers would recommend switching them off and using the electric backup heat. Today’s cold-climate units have enhanced heating capacity in cold weather, and should be left running under all outdoor conditions. Original Diagram Courtesy of David Pill, Pill-Maraham Architects
