### How to Shop for a Heat Pump in Five Steps


###### Step 5: Checklist of important questions to ask a contractor

Keep the following checklist of questions on hand to help ensure your contractor is prepared to correctly design and install your system:

- Can you provide references from previous customers with     similar systems?

- Have you participated in manufacturer training for the     systems you would install?

- Do you know about available incentives or rebates, and will     you provide assistance in applying for them?

- Do you use the NEEP Sizing and Selecting Guide and Cold-     Climate Installation Guide¹ 0 to inform your work?

- Will you choose equipment from the NEEP cold-climate air-     source heat pump list, and use the information in the listing     to help size the system properly?

- Where will you mount the outdoor unit(s), and how?     (Brackets bolted to an exterior wall may create unwanted     noise in a sensitive area like a bedroom; ground-mounted     units should always be on a stand to keep them above the     normal snow line. Units should also be shielded from rain     and snowmelt dripping off the roof.)

- If exterior “line sets” (piping) will be visible, where will they     be placed?

- What type of indoor units are you recommending, where will they be located, and why?

- Do you recommend a wall-mounted thermostat or control? (This is needed for ducted systems.     For ductless units serving larger spaces, it can enhance comfort by sensing the temperature in a     central location.)

- Do you always perform a triple evacuation before charging the refrigerant lines?

- Will I need to hire my own electrician to provide the electrical work? Will I need any electrical     service upgrade to accommodate the heat pumps? (This is not unusual in older houses.)

- Will you use any subcontractors in the process? If so, who are they and what jobs will they do?

- Will you provide training for me on how to properly operate and maintain the system?

- Do you provide a warranty for the systems you install, and how long is it? Always ask for a quote that details the equipment model numbers and itemizes any other parts and accessories that you’ll be charged for. If possible, try to get options for two or three alternatives from the same contractor so you can consider a range of options, with some explanation of the differences and the benefits of the various options.     10 Resources taken from: https://neep.org/ASHPInstallerResources


### Additional guidance to help you choose the right

### system size and design

A contractor that can answer the checklist of questions above is likely prepared to properly design and install air source heat systems in the best interest of you and your home. But to avoid unnecessary expense and give you additional confidence in your purchase, this section offers some additional tips for correct sizing and designing of many common system types, as well as how to avoid possible issues specific to that type of system. **Note:** This section is slightly more technical than the rest of this guide. This information is not imperative to know, but can help you choose the most efficient and cost-effective solution. _Centrally ducted heat pump:_ An outright replacement of a furnace with a ducted heat pump. _Things to consider with centrally ducted systems_

- If you’re using existing ductwork from a gas or oil     furnace, the air flow for a heat pump may be significantly     higher. A careful assessment of the ductwork is needed,     and significant duct upgrades may be necessary. Any     weatherization that has been done to the house helps reduce that possibility.

- Some centrally-ducted heat pumps have lower heating output at colder temperatures, and rely     on electric heaters in the ductwork to make up the difference in the coldest weather. Try to get a     heat pump with enough heating output to fully meet the heating load without needing the electric     heaters. If your installer still wants to put in an electric heaters, that’s OK – but find out how to shut     them off, until or unless you actually need them.

- Some houses have multiple furnaces. In that case, if you want to start small, replace the system     that serves the lower floor(s) of the house, or the most lived-in areas, first. It’s not common to     install a new central heat pump in a home that has no existing ducts, due to the expense of     building the ductwork. _Centrally ducted dual-fuel system:_ This may take the form of a new, dual-fuel furnace and heat pump system, or it may be a heat pump coil added to (or replacing) an air conditioner coil on an existing furnace. _Things to consider with dual-fuel systems_

- Dual fuel systems allow for the flexibility of heating with a heat     pump or with a more traditional gas or oil furnace. This can give     customers the chance to use each system optimally based on costs     and environmental benefits.

- In a dual-fuel system, the heat pump must shut off any time the     furnace runs. Often the heat pump can meet the heating needs     of the house, down to 30 or 20 degrees, or even lower. A dual-fuel     thermostat typically controls which system operates, based on the     outdoor temperature.


- A dual-fuel system won’t save as much of your existing heating fuel compared to a full-     replacement central heat pump, which eliminates use of the old fuel entirely.

- If you heat with oil or propane, a full replacement heat pump is cheaper to operate than dual-fuel;     with natural gas, the dual-fuel system is likely more economical for heating

- If you have a relatively new furnace with an older central AC, or if you are planning to add a new     central AC to the furnace, you might buy “up” to a heat pump. This creates a dual-fuel system for a     modest extra cost over an AC system.

- Care should be given in selecting an add-on heat pump coil that is compatible with your existing     furnace. You may need to settle for a non-“cold climate” heat pump that’s compatible with your     existing furnace, but it can still save significant heating fuel which a standard AC can’t. 11 _Ductless system:_ A single-zone system with a single indoor head (mounted high on the wall, low on the wall, or embedded in the ceiling) connected to a single outdoor unit. _Things to consider with ductless_

- A ductless unit can provide heating or cooling to     adjacent rooms when the rooms are in an “open plan”     with large open doorways or no walls between them.     But rooms with frequently closed doors will not get     nearly as much heat and will run cool in the winter.

- Remember there will be some room-to-room variation     in temperature if using a single zone system to     condition multiple rooms. If you prefer cool bedrooms in the winter, this may be ideal.

- If you like every room exactly the same, it may not be the best option unless you have a separate     heating zone for each bedroom.

- A first-floor ductless system can add significant heat to the upstairs bedrooms as well, if there is     an open stairway.

- First floor units won’t provide any cooling to the second floor, and upper floor units won’t heat the     first floor. If you want both heating and air conditioning in a two-story house, you’ll need at least     two indoor units.

- One or two ductless units may be all you need for a small house, or a very efficient (new or     renovated) house. Similarly, they could be the first step in the “start small” strategy discussed on     page 10. ¹¹Additional images (p. 9 top-left, middle-left & p. 15 bottom-right) provided by Bruce Harley, Bruce Harley Energy Consulting LLC


_Compact-ducted system:_ A variation of the ductless system, with recessed heads that utilize short runs of air ducts to serve two to four separate rooms (sometimes called a “ducted mini-split”) _Things to consider with compact-ducted:_

- A single compact-ducted system can provide     both heating and cooling in several smaller     rooms at higher efficiencies, and lower     operating costs, than a multi-zone system with     a ductless head in each room. Typical installation costs are similar.

- Make sure ducts are completely sealed and carefully insulated, especially if they are installed in an     attic, garage, or a vented crawlspace. Have the installer or a third party do a duct leakage test.

- Some compact-ducted systems don’t have a lot of fan power available to move the air. The     installer has to pay careful attention to selecting the right air handling unit, and to proper design of     the duct system.

- For many houses, a combination of one or more zones each of ducted and ductless is a great     setup. A ductless unit for the living/kitchen/dining area, and a compact-ducted for the bedrooms,     is common. A basement family room or addition that really needs to be a separate zone may     require its own ductless unit. _Multi-zone:_ Usually installed as a whole-home solution or to cover the majority of a home, a multi-zone system consists of multiple ductless and/or ducted indoor units in different areas of a house, all connected to a single outdoor unit. _Things to consider with multi-zone:_

- Although multi-zone is a convenient method to manage     comfort in separate rooms, it is also easy to over-size     multi-zone systems. Over-sizing can cause significant     operating problems including high operating cost and     over-heating of smaller rooms. It is far better to use a     separate, single-zone system for the main living space, at     least. It’s also best to combine bedrooms or other small     rooms with one to two compact-ducted systems, or to use     separate single-zone ductless heads in each room. Ask your installer to be strategic by minimizing     the total number of zones served by any multi-zone unit, while maximizing the number of single-     zone systems in the house.

- Single zone systems and multi-zone systems are comparable in cost per zone

- Some installers will propose an oversized multi-zone outdoor unit for “future expansion,” leaving     space for an additional indoor head to be installed later. Try to avoid this; it will hurt the operating     efficiency even more, costing extra for heating and cooling right from the start. Plan for any     expansion by adding another single-zone system.

- Some homes have very limited options for outdoor unit placement, for practical and/or aesthetic     reasons; that may tip the scales towards a single multi-zone system.        _(Source: Broadley’s Energy Solutions, 2019)_


### Integrated Controls

When you leave an existing central heating system (boiler or furnace) in place, and plan to use your heat pump as much as you can, it’s important to understand how the heat pump co-exists with the central system. If the heat pump is a centrally-ducted dual-fuel system, there will be one thermostat to handle both devices. But a central furnace or boiler may not “play well” with ductless unit(s) that are controlled with the typical hand-held remote. Depending on your house, there may be options for better controls. These include fairly standard wall-mounted thermostats (these may be wired or wireless) that help a ductless heat pump to better monitor the temperature of the whole room, or they may include “integrated controls” that manage both the heat pump(s) and the existing heating system. This will minimize the use of your existing heat while maximizing the use of the heat pump – and maximizing your savings.

### Once Your Heat Pump is Installed

There are a few things that make heat pumps different from other heating equipment you may be used to. Heat pumps naturally develop frost on the outdoor unit during operation, so all heat pumps have defrost cycles that will happen for a few minutes, every hour or so, when it’s cold outside. The unit may make gurgling sounds and briefly stop heating, but this is normal. In general, modern cold-climate heat pumps maintain a very warm output temperature even at below zero outdoor temperatures, but the air coming from the unit may not feel as “hot” as a conventional furnace. Coldclimate heat pumps will provide the most efficiency when the thermostat is not turned up and down dramatically

- set it for comfort, but generally “set it and forget it”. It will continue to produce heat (or cooling) at a slow and steady pace, which enhances comfort and saves you money. Also, it’s important to keep snow from piling up on or around the outdoor unit. That’s why it needs to be mounted up off the ground, but in extreme snow or drifting winds it’s good to check up and (gently!) shovel around and below the unit to keep it clear. Remember to change or wash the air filter(s) regularly. Refer to NEEP’s guide, Getting The Most Out of Your Heat Pump for lots more details and many helpful operating tips. **ASHP Myth #3: Heat pumps blow cold air** Heat pumps from past decades frequently had two problems that caused cold air to blow, leading to lots of comfort complaints. Every time they came on, the fan would run full blast, delivering cold air from the basement or attic as the heating coil slowly warmed up. Combined with the seriously reduced heating capacity of older models in cold weather, the air temperature at the supply registers would often feel cool or even cold. Modern cold climate systems have variable speed fans, improved controls and higher heating output – all working together to maintain cozy, warm temperatures.
