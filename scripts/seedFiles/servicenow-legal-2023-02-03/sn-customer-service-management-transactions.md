## "User" means any employee or contractor of Customer or Customer Affiliate that is assigned a unique username and password and has a user profile in the Subscription Service

## designated as "active". Only Users may be given access to the subscription service by Customer. A use right may not be shared or transferred. Customer shall not use the subscription

## “External User” Notwithstanding the definition of User, an External User is defined as Customer's external contacts, including, but not limited to Customer's accounts, consumers,

## households, partners or other contacts. External User may create, view, modify, or approve requests of their own or related accounts via the customer portal, approve requests for new

## contact creation; and manage users or assets of their own or related accounts. Customer is wholly responsible for External Users’ compliance with the terms of the Agreement and this

## ordering document, and all acts of omissions of such user. Such Users will not have the right to take any legal action against ServiceNow under this Agreement or any ordering

## document.

## “Unrestricted User" is every User that is assigned a unique username and has a user profile in the Subscription Service designated as “active”.
