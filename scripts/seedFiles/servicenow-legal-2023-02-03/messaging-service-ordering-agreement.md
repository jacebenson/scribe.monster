Messaging Service as mutually agreed to by the parties in writing and specifically made part of this Agreement; (d) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to or use of the Messaging Service and notify ServiceNow promptly of any such unauthorized access or use; (e) provide reasonable cooperation regarding information requests from law enforcement, regulators, or telecommunications providers; and (f) comply with the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5 (Warranties and Disclaimers) below.

2.3 Messaging Service Usage Restrictions. Customer will not (and will ensure its End Users do not): (a) transfer, resell, lease, license, or otherwise make available the Messaging Service to third parties (except to make the purchased Messaging Service available to its End Users), offer it on a standalone basis or use it in a manner that circumvents use limits or technological access control measures; (b) attempt to use the Messaging Service to contact or allow End Users to contact an official government-sponsored emergency telephone number (such as 911 in North America or 112 in the European Union and other locations worldwide) which is used to dispatch professional emergency responders **(“** **_Emergency Services_** **”** ), unless the Messaging Service is expressly identified as approved by ServiceNow for Emergency Services in a written addendum to this Agreement; (c) use the Messaging Service in any manner that violates the Acceptable Use Policy or any applicable Law; or (d) use the Messaging Service to create, use, send, store, or run viruses or other harmful computer code, files, scripts, agents, or other programs, or otherwise engage in a malicious act or disrupt its security, integrity, or operation.

2.5 Suspension of Messaging Service. ServiceNow may suspend the Messaging Service immediately upon notice to Customer for cause if: (a) Customer or an End User materially breaches (or ServiceNow reasonably believes that Customer or an End User has materially breached) any provision of this Agreement, including its obligations under the Acceptable Use Policy; (b) there is an unusual and material spike or increase in Customer’s use of the Messaging Services and ServiceNow believes that such traffic or use is fraudulent or materially and negatively impacting the operating capability of the Messaging Service; (c) ServiceNow determines that its provision of the Messaging Service is prohibited by applicable Law; or (d) there is any use of the Messaging Service by Customer or an End User that in ServiceNow’s reasonable judgment threatens the security, integrity, or availability of the Messaging Service. Except to the extent required by any third party (e.g., telecommunications carrier, regulatory body), ServiceNow shall, where reasonably practicable and insofar as the security, integrity or availability of Messaging Service is not threatened by such notice, provide Customer prior written notice before exercising its right to suspend the Messaging Service. However, ServiceNow will use commercially reasonable efforts under the circumstances to (x) provide Customer with notice and an opportunity to remedy such violation or threat prior to any such suspension; (y) where practicable, limit the suspension based on the circumstances leading to the suspension (e.g., to certain phone numbers, or other subset of traffic); and (z) remove the suspension as quickly as reasonably practicable after the circumstances leading to the suspension have been resolved. If Customer’s account is blocked because it is operating in a country or region prohibited under Section 5.1(b), Customer will receive notice of its account being inoperable when Customer attempts to log into its account in the restricted country or region.

2.6 Changes to the Messaging Service. Customer acknowledges that the features and functions of the Messaging Service may change over time; provided, however, ServiceNow will

not materially decrease the overall functionality of the Messaging Service during the Subscription Term. Although ServiceNow endeavors to avoid changes to the Messaging Service’s APIs that are not backwards compatible, if any such changes become necessary, ServiceNow will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Customer prior to implementation. In the event that ServiceNow makes a non-backwards compatible change to a Messaging Service’s API and such change materially and negatively impacts Customer’s use of the Messaging Service **(“** **_Adverse API Change_** **”** ), then (a) Customer shall notify ServiceNow of the Adverse API Change and (b) ServiceNow may agree to work with the Customer to resolve or otherwise address the Adverse API Change, except where ServiceNow, in its sole discretion, has determined that an Adverse API Change is required for security reasons, by telecommunications providers, or to comply with applicable Law. If the parties cannot, in good faith, find a mutually agreeable solution and the Adverse API Change: (a) imposes additional, material, adverse obligations or liability upon Customer, and (b) is not required by applicable Law or pursuant to requirements of telecommunications providers, then within thirty (30) days of such Adverse API Change notice, Customer may terminate this Agreement for convenience upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to ServiceNow. Customer must pay within thirty (30) days of the effective date of termination all amounts which have accrued prior to such termination and ServiceNow will refund any prepaid unused fees for the terminated Messaging Service.

2.7 Beta Offerings. From time to time, Beta Offerings may be made available to Customer. Customer may, in its sole discretion, choose to use such Beta Offerings. Beta Offerings may be discontinued at any time and Beta Offerings may never become generally available. For avoidance of doubt, such Beta Offerings are not the Messaging Service as contemplated under this Agreement.

## 3. Taxes

All payments required by this Agreement are stated exclusive of all taxes, duties, levies, imposts, fines, or similar governmental assessments, including sales and use taxes, value-added taxes ( **“VAT”** ), goods and services taxes ( **“GST”** ), excise, business, service, and similar transactional taxes imposed by any jurisdiction, and the interest and penalties on any and all of these (collectively, “Taxes”). Customer is solely liable for and will pay all Taxes associated with its purchase of, payment for, access to, or use of, the Messaging Service. For the avoidance of doubt, Taxes will not be deducted from payments to ServiceNow, except as required by Law, in which case Customer will increase the amount payable as necessary so that, after making all required deductions and withholdings, ServiceNow receives and retains (free from any liability for Taxes) an amount equal to the amount it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made. When applicable, Customer will provide to ServiceNow its VAT or GST identification number(s) on the Order Form. Customer will use the ordered Service for Customer’s business use in accordance with the provided VAT or GST identification number(s) of its business establishment(s).

 4.3 Confidentiality.

(a) Definition. **“** **_Confidential Information_** **”** means any information or data, regardless of whether it is in tangible form, disclosed by either party **(“** **_Disclosing Party_** **”** ) to the other party ( **“** **_Receiving Party_** **”** ) that is marked or otherwise designated as confidential or proprietary or that should otherwise be reasonably understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances surrounding disclosure, including, without limitation, Customer Data, security reports and attestations, audit reports, customer lists, pricing, phone numbers, concepts, processes, plans, designs and other strategies, “know how”, financial, and other business and/or technical information and materials of the Disclosing Party and its Affiliates.

(b) Use and Disclosure. The Receiving Party will use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information (but not less than reasonable care) to (i) not use any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose outside the scope of this Agreement and (ii) except as otherwise authorized by the Disclosing Party in writing, limit access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to those of its and its Affiliates’ employees, legal counsel, accountants, and contractors (collectively, **“** **_Representatives_** **”** ) who need that access for purposes consistent with this Agreement and who are legally bound to keep such information confidential consistent with the terms of this Section 4.3. Neither party will disclose the terms of this Agreement or any Order Form or other purchase of Services to any third party other than its Representatives without the other party’s prior written consent, provided that a party will remain responsible for compliance with this Section 4.3 (Confidentiality) by its Affiliates and Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) ServiceNow or Twilio may disclose the terms of this Agreement and any applicable purchase transaction to a subcontractor to the extent necessary to perform the s obligations under this Agreement; and (y) ServiceNow or Twilio may use and disclose Confidential Information of Customer solely to the extent necessary to provide the Messaging Service and as further described in the Messaging Service Privacy Exhibit.

The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if so required pursuant to Law ( **“** **_Compelled Disclosure_** **”** ), provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party notice of a Compelled Disclosure (to the extent legally permitted). The Disclosing Party shall cover the Receiving Party's reasonable legal fees for preparation of witnesses, deposition, and testimony to the extent such Compelled Disclosure is in connection with a lawsuit or legal proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party or to the extent fees are incurred in connection with reasonable assistance provided to the Disclosing Party in connection with the Disclosing Party's efforts to contest a Compelled Disclosure.

(d) Injunctive Relief. The parties expressly acknowledge and agree that no adequate remedy exists at Law for an actual or threatened breach of this Section 4.3 and that, in the event of an actual or threatened breach of the provisions of this Section 4.3, the non-breaching party will be entitled to seek immediate injunctive and other equitable relief, without waiving any other rights or remedies available to it.

 4.4 Use of Customer Data.

Customer instructs ServiceNow to use and disclose Customer Data solely to the extent necessary to (a) provide the Messaging Service in accordance with Section 4.3 (Confidentiality), this Section 4.4, and the Messaging Service Privacy Exhibit. For clarity, ServiceNow or Twilio may use Customer Data to detect, prevent, and investigate security incidents, fraud, spam, or unlawful use of the Messaging Service by third-parties and support the Messaging Service by responding to Customer’s technical problems or queries, and ensure the proper working of the Messaging Service. Customer acknowledges that the Internet and telecommunications providers’ networks are inherently insecure. Accordingly, Customer agrees that neither ServiceNow nor Twilio are not liable for any changes to, interception of, or loss of Customer Data while in transit via the Internet or a telecommunications provider’s network.

ServiceNow will indemnify Customer from any settlement amount or final award of damages, attorney fees, and costs awarded against Customer Indemnified Parties for such Infringement Claim, or for amounts paid by Customer Indemnified Parties in accordance with Section 6.3 below, to settle an Infringement Claim.

(c) Limitations.

material violation of the specific and applicable industry standard governing Customer’s or any of its End Users’ use of the Messaging Service and published by: the CTIA (Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association), the Mobile Marketing Association, or other generally recognized industry association or regulated telecommunications provider guidelines and usage requirements for which ServiceNow has given adequate notice to Customer; or (b) any claims that the Customer Application or the Customer’s or its End User’s use of the Customer Application infringes or misappropriates such third party’s intellectual property rights, where a Customer Application means any software application or service that Customer makes available to End Users that interfaces with the Messaging Service (collectively, **“** **_Customer Indemnifiable Claims_** **”** ) and will indemnify ServiceNow from any settlement amount or final award of damages, attorney fees, and costs finally awarded against ServiceNow Indemnified Parties for such Customer Indemnifiable Claims, or for amounts paid by ServiceNow Indemnified Parties in accordance with Section 6.3 below to settle a Customer Indemnifiable Claim.

The Indemnified Party reserves the right, at its own expense, to participate in the defense of a Claim. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Indemnifying Party will not settle any Claims for which it has an obligation to indemnify under this Section 6 admitting liability or fault on behalf of the Indemnified Party, nor create any obligation on behalf of the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

6.4 Exclusive Remedy. This Section 6 (Mutual Indemnification) states the Indemnifying Party’s sole liability to, and the Indemnified Party’s exclusive remedy against, the other party for any third party claims.
