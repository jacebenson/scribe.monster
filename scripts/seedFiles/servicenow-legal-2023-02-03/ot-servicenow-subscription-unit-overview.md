##### “ Container” is any operating system-level virtualization represented as a CI in a CMDB table

##### listed below and managed by an OT application.

##### “End User Computing Device” is any physical or virtual computing device that is not

##### defined as another Managed OT Resource Type and has an Agent Client Collector

##### installed. Agent Client Collector is a ServiceNow agent that is installed on infrastructure

##### components. End User Computing Devices are represented as a CI in a CMDB table

##### listed below and managed by an OT application.

##### “OT Supervisory System” is any OT supervisory system that is represented as a configuration

##### item (“CI”) in a CMDB table listed below and managed by OT.

##### “OT Control System” is any OT control system that is represented as a configuration item (“CI”)

##### in a CMDB table listed below and managed by OT.

##### “OT Field Device” is any OT field device that is represented as a CI in a CMDB table listed below

##### and managed by OT.

##### “Unclassed OT” is any non-classified Operational Technology entity that is represented as a

##### configuration item (“CI”) in a CMDB table listed below and managed by OT using the cmdb_ci_ot

##### class or any class derived from the cmdb_ci_ot class not defined as another Managed OT

##### Resource Type.
