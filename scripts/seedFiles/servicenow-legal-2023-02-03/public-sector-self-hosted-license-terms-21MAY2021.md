**4.1** RESELLER ORDERS. Customer shall order and purchase the license to the Software and any Professional Services directly from Reseller pursuant to a separate agreement between Customer and Reseller which specifies price, payment, and other commercial terms reflected in an Ordering Document.

Subsequent or additional orders for ServiceNow Software or Professional Services may be placed by Customer through Reseller. If ServiceNow or Reseller determines that Customer has exceeded its permitted license rights under the Use Verification Section of the SHSG or this License, ServiceNow or Reseller will notify Customer, and Customer will within 30 days, either: (1) disable any unpermitted use, or (2) purchase additional Software licenses commensurate with Customer’s actual use. If Customer fails to regain compliance within such thirty (30) day period, Customer will stop using the Software and ServiceNow and Reseller may suspend Customer’s use of the Software, in addition to any other available rights or remedies. 

**5. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY** 

**5.1** SERVICENOW OWNERSHIP. As between the parties, ServiceNow and its licensors exclusively own all right, title, and interest in and to all IPR in the ServiceNow Core Technology, notwithstanding anything in an Ordering Document or other documents purportedly to the contrary. Except for the access and use rights, and licenses expressly granted in Section 3 , ServiceNow, on behalf of itself and its licensors, reserves all rights in the ServiceNow Core Technology and does not grant Customer any rights except those expressly set forth herein. Any ServiceNow Core Technology delivered to Customer, or to which Customer is given access has been licensed, not sold, even if, for convenience, ServiceNow or Reseller makes reference to words such as “sale” or “purchase” in the applicable Ordering Document or other documents. 

**5.2** CUSTOMER OWNERSHIP. As between the parties, Customer and its licensors will retain all right, title, and interest in and to all IPR in Customer Data and Customer Technology. Customer grants to ServiceNow a royalty-free, fullypaid, non-exclusive, non-transferrable (except under Section 11 .1 (“Assignment”), worldwide right to use Customer Data and Customer Technology solely to provide and support the ServiceNow Software and Professional Service. 

**5.3** FEEDBACK. If Customer provides suggestions, proposals, ideas, recommendations, or other feedback regarding improvements to the Software or Professional Services (collectively, “ **Feedback** ”) Customer grants to ServiceNow a royaltyfree, fully paid, sub-licensable, transferable (notwithstanding Section 11.1), non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide right and license to use, license, and commercialize Feedback (including by incorporation of such Feedback into ServiceNow Core Technology) without restriction. 

**5.4** PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. Subject to this Section 5.4, ServiceNow assigns (and in the future is deemed to have assigned) to Customer any Newly Created IP upon receipt of payment in full to ServiceNow under the SOW that specifies the creation of Newly Created IP.

Nothing in this License may be construed to limit ServiceNow’s right to perform (and to assign employees or contractors to perform) similar Professional Services for any other party or to use any information incidentally retained in the unaided memories of its employees providing Professional Services. 

**6. WARRANTIES; DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES** 

**6.1** SERVICENOW WARRANTIES. ServiceNow warrants that: (1) for a period of ninety (90) days after ServiceNow makes the Software available to Customer it will materially conform to the Product Overview; and (2) Professional Services will be performed in a competent and workmanlike manner in accordance with accepted industry standards and practices and all material requirements in the applicable SOW or Service Description.

## 6.2 REMEDIES. 

**6.2.1.** SOFTWARE. If any non-conformity to the Product Overview (excluding any non-conformity (i) caused by a modification to the Software made by Customer or a third-party acting at Customer’s direction, or (ii) to Software that has not been properly installed or used at all times in accordance with the instructions in the SHSG), persists without relief more than 30 days after Customer’s notice to the Reseller of the non-conformity, then upon ServiceNow’s timely receipt of such notice from Reseller, Customer may terminate the licenses to the affected Software immediately, and as Customer’s exclusive remedy ServiceNow will refund to Reseller any prepaid subscription fees covering the remainder of the applicable License Term for the non-conforming Software after the date of termination, whereupon Customer may submit to Reseller a claim for refund of any amounts paid for the same. 

**6.2.2.** PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. If within 30 days after performance of any non-conforming Professional Services Customer notifies Reseller of a breach then, ServiceNow at its option will, as Customer’s exclusive remedy either use commercially reasonable efforts to re-perform the Professional Services in conformance with the material requirements of the applicable SOW or Service Description or terminate the affected Professional Services and refund to Reseller any amounts paid for the nonconforming Professional Services, whereupon Customer may submit to Reseller a claim for refund of any amounts paid for the same. 

**6.3** DISCLAIMER. **Except for the warranties expressly stated in this Section 6 , to the maximum extent allowed by Law, ServiceNow disclaims all warranties of any kind (express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, oral or written, including warranties of merchantability, accuracy, title, non-infringement, or fitness for a particular purpose, and any warranties arising from usage of trade, course of dealing, or course of performance). Without limiting the above, ServiceNow does not warrant that the Software: (1) will meet the requirements of Customer or others; or (2) will be accurate or operate without interruption or error; or (3) is designed for any purpose requiring fail-safe performance for which failure could result in death, personal injury or severe physical, property, or environmental damage.** 

**7. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION** 

**7.1** RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS. To the extent permitted by law, the recipient of Confidential Information will: **( 1 )** at all times protect it from unauthorized disclosure with the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential information, and in no event less than reasonable care; and **( 2 )** not use it except to the extent necessary to exercise rights and obligations under the Ordering Document or this License. Each party will limit the disclosure of the other’s Confidential Information to those of its employees and contractors with a need to know such Confidential Information to exercise its rights and obligations under the Ordering Document and this License, and then only to employees and contractors subject to binding disclosure and use restrictions at least as protective as those in this License. Each party’s obligations under this Section 7 will remain in effect during, and for 3 years after termination of this License. Receiving party will, at disclosing party’s request, return all originals, copies, reproductions, and summaries of Confidential Information and other tangible materials and devices provided to receiving party as Confidential Information, or at disclosing party’s option, certify destruction of the same. 

**7.2** THIRD PARTY REQUESTS. This License will not prevent receiving party from disclosing the other party’s Confidential Information to a court, or governmental body pursuant to a valid court order, Law, subpoena, or regulation, but only if receiving party: **( 1 )** gives prompt notice (or the maximum notice permitted under Law) before making the disclosure, unless prohibited by Law; **( 2 )** to the extent permitted by law, reasonably assists disclosing party, at disclosing party’s cost, in its lawful efforts to resist or limit such disclosure; and **( 3 )** discloses only that portion of disclosing party’s Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed.

**8.1** BY SERVICENOW. **8.1.1.** OBLIGATION.

**8.1.3.** LIMITATIONS. Notwithstanding the above, ServiceNow has no obligation or liability for any Claim under Section 8.1.1( 1 )(a) to the extent arising from: **( 1 )** use of any ServiceNow Core Technology not expressly authorized under this License, to the extent the Claim would have been avoided without such use; **( 2 )** Customer Data or Customer Technology; or **( 3 )** use of ServiceNow Core Technology: **(a)** in violation of Law; **(b)** after termination under Section 8.1.2( 4 ); or **( 4 )** modification to the ServiceNow Core Technology to Customer’s specifications or by anyone other than ServiceNow or its contractors, or if combined with anything not provided by ServiceNow, if the Claim would have been avoided but for such modifications or combinations. 

**8.2** CUSTOMER WARRANTY.

**8.3** PROCESS. ServiceNow’s duty to indemnify under Section 8 .1 is subject to Customer **( 1 )** notifying ServiceNow promptly of any actual or threatened Claim, **( 2 )** except where prohibited by Law, giving ServiceNow sole control of the defense of such Claim and of any related settlement negotiations, and **( 3 )** cooperating and, at ServiceNow’s reasonable request and expense, allowing ServiceNow to assist in such defense. Neither party will stipulate, acknowledge, or admit fault or liability on the other’s part without the other’s prior, written consent.

**9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY** 

**9.1 LIMITED LIABILITY. ServiceNow shall have no liability for any refund that, in accordance with this License, is to be paid by Reseller.
