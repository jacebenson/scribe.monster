**_** UPGRADE POLICY **Why Stay Current?** Staying current by upgrading to new release families is crucial to customer success. Staying current enables you to take full advantage of the innovations made available through our releases, to deploy new products, and to get the highest levels of security, availability, and performance. **Supported and Unsupported Release Families** The current policy of ServiceNow is to support the most recent and the immediately previous release families. Because ServiceNow generally releases two new release families per year, you will need to upgrade approximately once per year to stay on a supported release family. The timing and frequency of releases is subject to change at the sole discretion of ServiceNow. ServiceNow provides Updates (e.g., patches and hotfixes) only for supported release families. **Required Upgrades** You generally can schedule upgrades at your convenience; however, if you fall behind and your instance is on an unsupported release family, ServiceNow will schedule an upgrade for your instance to the most current release family to ensure access to the latest features as well as the latest security, performance, and availability benefits.
