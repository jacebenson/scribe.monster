### 1. IT Operations Management (ITOM)

#### 1.1. Managed IT Resource Types

##### “ Server ” is any physical or virtual server that is represented as a configuration item (“CI”) in a

##### CMDB table listed below and managed by an IT Operations Management (“ITOM”)

##### application.

##### “ PaaS Resource ” is any cloud-based platform service represented as a CI in a CMDB table

##### listed below and managed by an ITOM application.

##### “ Container” is any operating system-level virtualization represented as a CI in a CMDB table

##### listed below and managed by an ITOM application.

##### “ Unresolved Monitored Object ” is any IT Resource for which the ITOM Health Application

##### receives an event or performance metric which is not represented as a CI in a CMDB table.

##### Unresolved Monitored Objects are recorded in the “em_unique_nodes” table with the

##### “type” field equal to “unknown”.

##### Servers PaaS Resources Containers

 cmdb_ci_server cmdb_ci_cloud_appserver cmdb_ci_oslv_container cmdb_ci_vm_instance cmdb_ci_cloud_database Any CMDB classes derived from the above listed classes cmdb_ci_ucs_rack_unit cmdb_ci_dynamodb_table cmdb_ci_ucs_blade cmdb_ci_cloud_directory cmdb_ci_mainframe_hardware cmdb_ci_cloud_function Any CMDB classes derived from the above listed classes cmdb_ci_cloud_gateway cmdb_ci_cloud_messaging_service cmdb_ci_cloud_webserver Any CMDB classes derived from the above listed classes
