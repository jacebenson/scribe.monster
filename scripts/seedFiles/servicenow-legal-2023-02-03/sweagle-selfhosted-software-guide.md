## APPENDIX A.3 – SWEAGLE PLANNING AND DEPLOYMENT GUIDE 

### Overview 

### This document provides an overview of the Sweagle environment and helps you prepare for provisioning. The 

### architectural hardware and software described below are purely suggestions based on ServiceNow's experienceusing 

### these components in other self-hosted deployments, and do not represent a warranty, representation or guarantee. 

### Audience 

### Typical audiences for this document include system administrators, database administrators (DBAs), networkengineers, 

### architects, and helpdesk management. 

### Sweagle architecture 

### When considering how to deploy your Sweagle environment, consider important issues such as sizing, andscalability. 

### The following diagram shows a standard Sweagle configuration. 

### For production purposes, Sweagle recommends a fully redundant architecture for its various components. Sweagle 

### supports active-active & active passive load balancing and CORE instances can be brought up and shutdown 

### dynamically without causing service downtime. 


#### SWEAGLE SELF-H OSTED 

### Prerequisites 

### The following third-party software components are required on the server and to be installed by the customer priorto 

### starting the installation of Sweagle. The platform does not embed or package any of those components. 

### Operating system and server utilities 

- Java 1.8 (v8). This can be openJDK 1.8 or Oracle Java 8 

- graalVM v19.2.1 (only for the server running scriptExecutor) 

- curl v7 or higher 

- unzip 

- screen 

- optionally: JQ (install instructions can be found here: https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) 

### Technical components 

### The following list of technical components can be either the community edition version or the enterprise version(in 

### which case ensure you have the appropriate licenses in place and are allowed to use the software) 

- MySQL v5.7 and mysql-connector-java-8.0.13.jar 

- Elastic Search v7.5.1 

- NGINX (latest stable community edition) 

- Vault v0.7 or higher (download from HashiCorp) 

- MongoDB v4.x community edition 

### Recommended sizing 

### Server Type # of VM CPU RAM disk size 

### Server Type1: nginx + UI + taskRunner 1 single-CPU 4GB 15GB 

### Server Type2: core+scriptExec+Vault 

### (+taskRunner) 

### 2 or more dual-CPU 15GB 15GB 

### Server Type3: mongoDb + ElasticSearch 3 dual-CPU 8GB 50GB 

### Server Type4: mySql db (Primary/Secondary) 2 dual-CPU 8GB 20GB 

### Server Type4: mySql db Clustered 3 dual-CPU 8GB 20GB 

### Users and permissions 

### Sweagle requires a user with administrative permissions on the server to install, stop, and start services. Sudo 

### permissions (on Linux) or local system admin (on Windows) are required. 

### DBA permissions are required on the database to create the Sweagle data schemas. Once installed, Sweaglerequires 

### an application user on the database which has full permissions in the Sweagle data schemas. 

### Ports and protocols 

### The following ports are required for the Sweagle application: 


- HTTP(s) access to the Sweagle UI component on NGINX. The default port used is 80 / 443. 

### But this isconfigurable at start time of the Sweagle component 

- For a remote MySQL database, TCP connectivity on the database port (default 3306) 

- For remote ElasticSearch, TCP connectivity (default 9300 and 9200). 

- For a remote MongoDB, TCP connectivity (default 27017). 

- SSH access to the server for installation and configuration (default 22). 

### Other default port configurations: 

- sweagleCore: 8081 

- sweagleTaskRunner: 8082 

- sweagleScriptExecutor: 8083 

- sweagleVault: 8200 

### Deploying sub-production environments 

### Most customers setup 1 to 3 sub-production environments in addition to the primary production 

### environment. Sub-production environments are typically "All in One” environments, so the data node 

### and the search nodes are deployed on the same VM/server
