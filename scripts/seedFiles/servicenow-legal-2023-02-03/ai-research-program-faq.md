## What is the AI Research Program?

The AI Research Program supports ServiceNow's commitment to delivering best-in-class AIpowered solutions. Artificial Intelligence depends on models being trained and optimized using representative data sets so that the AI algorithms can learn real-world vocabularies to improve performance for users. In support of increasing the efficacy of ServiceNow's AI solutions, the AI Research Terms are included in all customer agreements.

## What is the goal of the AI Research Program?

By conducting AI training on real-world data, ServiceNow will improve the quality of applications on the ServiceNow platform to help customers transform their organizations and work smarter, faster.

## What happens after the Order Form is signed?

ServiceNow will clone the instance associated with the signed Order Form. This clone will be maintained in the same region as the production instance to ensure data sovereignty. The same data security protections detailed in your ServiceNow master ordering agreement apply, and access to the clone will be limited to members of the AI Research Program team.

## How can I participate in the AI Research Program?

Participation is 100% optional and is accomplished by signing an order form with the AI Research Terms included. If you have questions, you may contact your Account Executive, or you can reach out to dart.join@servicenow.com to request more information.

## How do I leave the AI Research program?

At any time during the subscription term of the order form, you may terminate your participation in the AI Research Program by using the AI Research Program Opt-out service catalog request on the Now Support (HI) portal. ServiceNow will delete the cloned instances within fifteen business days.
