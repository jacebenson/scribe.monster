Kali: Tell us about your current role and the type of work you do.

Jace: I've always just **considered myself a ServiceNow Developer**.  My current role is a little different then my past roles.  This role has a more **solid mentoring component** to it.  So that's great.  Outside of that, like any developer **I read and write a lot**.

- I read the requirements of stories and help flesh them out
- I read the code that implements the stories and code review it
- I read lots of documentation when I'm trying to figure out how to do something

When I'm not reading, I'm writing.
- I write design notes to help flesh out the requirements of stories.
- I write code.
- I write documentation.
- I write emails.

Kali: How did you start your career path?

Jace: I was coming back from a patient escort run at **local hospital** when my **boss Sheryl was staying late** to manually do the math for every cell after 500 for when a run started and ended.  I **taught her how to write a Excel formula to do the math** for her.  She told me I'm too smart for this job and I should find something with computers.  I looked within the hospital and found role entering data into a electronical medical record system.  Then they were having computer problems and **I was fixing those computer problems** as they came up.  A coworker told me I should work on the Help Desk.  I was like what's that (thinking the desks you might find at Target or Cub).  Turned out I was a natural at the job.  They were switching form using emails to manage changes to using ServiceNow and at the end of the implementation, they were like **"Jace you said you did web stuff for fun, build the catalog"  I did and I was hooked**.

Kali: What's your superpower?

Jace: Writing.  **Writing stuff** down.  Being okay **being uncomfortable**.  The other month Mark Scott had a live stream with Chuck Tomasi and I was thinking about who would see it and what they might think if I was wrong.  But, I just kept on going.  I wanted a meetup and I never organized a thing like that in the past, but if you don't try it how do you know how you'll feel about it.  So try things (even if your not sure you'll like it) and write stuff down.

Kali: What's your approach to learning?

Jace: I really like the **FreeCodeCamps motto** on this.  "**Read, Search, (Don't be afraid to) Ask**".  But really I like to just jump in.  So I might think of it as "**Try until you're stuck, then...** read, search, ask".  I learn best by making something.  I get a great feeling for what excites me and what doesn't.

Kali: Share a bit about some of your current projects (ie you app)

Jace: I have a bunch but my most recent two are https://news.jace.pro a news aggregator for ServiceNow news that automatically updates every hour.  The other more recent is my way of learning AI.  https://scribe.monster is a chrome extension that will help you read and write code.  It's not right for everyone, but it's a starting point when you don't have one.
